      "Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece and\n",
      "his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long,\n",
      "white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back\n",
      "his left shirt-cuff. For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully\n",
      "upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with\n",
      "innumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point home,\n",
      "pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined\n",
      "arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but\n",
      "custom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day to\n",
      "day I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled\n",
      "nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to\n",
      "protest. Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver\n",
      "my soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant\n",
      "air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would\n",
      "care to take anything approaching to a liberty. His great powers, his\n",
      "masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his many\n",
      "extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had taken\n",
      "with my lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme\n",
      "deliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out no\n",
      "longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which is it to-day?” I asked,—“morphine or cocaine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he\n",
      "had opened. “It is cocaine,” he said,—“a seven-per-cent. solution.\n",
      "Would you care to try it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed,” I answered, brusquely. “My constitution has not got over\n",
      "the Afghan campaign yet. I cannot afford to throw any extra strain upon\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He smiled at my vehemence. “Perhaps you are right, Watson,” he said. “I\n",
      "suppose that its influence is physically a bad one. I find it, however,\n",
      "so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its\n",
      "secondary action is a matter of small moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But consider!” I said, earnestly. “Count the cost! Your brain may, as\n",
      "you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and morbid\n",
      "process, which involves increased tissue-change and may at last leave a\n",
      "permanent weakness. You know, too, what a black reaction comes upon\n",
      "you. Surely the game is hardly worth the candle. Why should you, for a\n",
      "mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which\n",
      "you have been endowed? Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to\n",
      "another, but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to\n",
      "some extent answerable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not seem offended. On the contrary, he put his finger-tips\n",
      "together and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair, like one who\n",
      "has a relish for conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My mind,” he said, “rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me\n",
      "work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate\n",
      "analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then\n",
      "with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence.\n",
      "I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own\n",
      "particular profession,—or rather created it, for I am the only one in\n",
      "the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The only unofficial detective?” I said, raising my eyebrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The only unofficial consulting detective,” he answered. “I am the last\n",
      "and highest court of appeal in detection. When Gregson or Lestrade or\n",
      "Athelney Jones are out of their depths—which, by the way, is their\n",
      "normal state—the matter is laid before me. I examine the data, as an\n",
      "expert, and pronounce a specialist’s opinion. I claim no credit in such\n",
      "cases. My name figures in no newspaper. The work itself, the pleasure\n",
      "of finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward. But\n",
      "you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the\n",
      "Jefferson Hope case.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, indeed,” said I, cordially. “I was never so struck by anything in\n",
      "my life. I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat\n",
      "fantastic title of ‘A Study in Scarlet.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head sadly. “I glanced over it,” said he. “Honestly, I\n",
      "cannot congratulate you upon it. Detection is, or ought to be, an exact\n",
      "science, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner.\n",
      "You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which produces much\n",
      "the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the\n",
      "fifth proposition of Euclid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the romance was there,” I remonstrated. “I could not tamper with\n",
      "the facts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some facts should be suppressed, or at least a just sense of\n",
      "proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the\n",
      "case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from\n",
      "effects to causes by which I succeeded in unraveling it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially\n",
      "designed to please him. I confess, too, that I was irritated by the\n",
      "egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be\n",
      "devoted to his own special doings. More than once during the years that\n",
      "I had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small vanity\n",
      "underlay my companion’s quiet and didactic manner. I made no remark,\n",
      "however, but sat nursing my wounded leg. I had a Jezail bullet through\n",
      "it some time before, and, though it did not prevent me from walking, it\n",
      "ached wearily at every change of the weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My practice has extended recently to the Continent,” said Holmes,\n",
      "after a while, filling up his old brier-root pipe. “I was consulted\n",
      "last week by François Le Villard, who, as you probably know, has come\n",
      "rather to the front lately in the French detective service. He has all\n",
      "the Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the wide\n",
      "range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments\n",
      "of his art. The case was concerned with a will, and possessed some\n",
      "features of interest. I was able to refer him to two parallel cases,\n",
      "the one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis in 1871, which have\n",
      "suggested to him the true solution. Here is the letter which I had this\n",
      "morning acknowledging my assistance.” He tossed over, as he spoke, a\n",
      "crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper. I glanced my eyes down it,\n",
      "catching a profusion of notes of admiration, with stray “magnifiques,”\n",
      "“coup-de-maîtres,” and “tours-de-force,” all testifying to the ardent\n",
      "admiration of the Frenchman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He speaks as a pupil to his master,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, he rates my assistance too highly,” said Sherlock Holmes, lightly.\n",
      "“He has considerable gifts himself. He possesses two out of the three\n",
      "qualities necessary for the ideal detective. He has the power of\n",
      "observation and that of deduction. He is only wanting in knowledge; and\n",
      "that may come in time. He is now translating my small works into\n",
      "French.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your works?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, didn’t you know?” he cried, laughing. “Yes, I have been guilty of\n",
      "several monographs. They are all upon technical subjects. Here, for\n",
      "example, is one ‘Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various\n",
      "Tobaccoes.’ In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar-,\n",
      "cigarette-, and pipe-tobacco, with coloured plates illustrating the\n",
      "difference in the ash. It is a point which is continually turning up in\n",
      "criminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a\n",
      "clue. If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder has been\n",
      "done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously narrows\n",
      "your field of search. To the trained eye there is as much difference\n",
      "between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of\n",
      "bird’s-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have an extraordinary genius for minutiæ,” I remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I appreciate their importance. Here is my monograph upon the tracing\n",
      "of footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a\n",
      "preserver of impresses. Here, too, is a curious little work upon the\n",
      "influence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the\n",
      "hands of slaters, sailors, corkcutters, compositors, weavers, and\n",
      "diamond-polishers. That is a matter of great practical interest to the\n",
      "scientific detective,—especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or in\n",
      "discovering the antecedents of criminals. But I weary you with my\n",
      "hobby.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all,” I answered, earnestly. “It is of the greatest interest to\n",
      "me, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your\n",
      "practical application of it. But you spoke just now of observation and\n",
      "deduction. Surely the one to some extent implies the other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, hardly,” he answered, leaning back luxuriously in his arm-chair,\n",
      "and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe. “For example,\n",
      "observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street\n",
      "Post-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there\n",
      "you dispatched a telegram.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right!” said I. “Right on both points! But I confess that I don’t see\n",
      "how you arrived at it. It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I have\n",
      "mentioned it to no one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is simplicity itself,” he remarked, chuckling at my surprise,—“so\n",
      "absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may\n",
      "serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction. Observation\n",
      "tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep.\n",
      "Just opposite the Wigmore Street Office they have taken up the pavement\n",
      "and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult\n",
      "to avoid treading in it in entering. The earth is of this peculiar\n",
      "reddish tint which is found, as far as I know, nowhere else in the\n",
      "neighbourhood. So much is observation. The rest is deduction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How, then, did you deduce the telegram?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I sat\n",
      "opposite to you all morning. I see also in your open desk there that\n",
      "you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards. What could\n",
      "you go into the post-office for, then, but to send a wire? Eliminate\n",
      "all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In this case it certainly is so,” I replied, after a little thought.\n",
      "“The thing, however, is, as you say, of the simplest. Would you think\n",
      "me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the contrary,” he answered, “it would prevent me from taking a\n",
      "second dose of cocaine. I should be delighted to look into any problem\n",
      "which you might submit to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object\n",
      "in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it\n",
      "in such a way that a trained observer might read it. Now, I have here a\n",
      "watch which has recently come into my possession. Would you have the\n",
      "kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the\n",
      "late owner?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my\n",
      "heart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I\n",
      "intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he\n",
      "occasionally assumed. He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at\n",
      "the dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked\n",
      "eyes and then with a powerful convex lens. I could hardly keep from\n",
      "smiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and\n",
      "handed it back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are hardly any data,” he remarked. “The watch has been recently\n",
      "cleaned, which robs me of my most suggestive facts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are right,” I answered. “It was cleaned before being sent to me.”\n",
      "In my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and\n",
      "impotent excuse to cover his failure. What data could he expect from an\n",
      "uncleaned watch?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,” he\n",
      "observed, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes.\n",
      "“Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to\n",
      "your elder brother, who inherited it from your father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That you gather, no doubt, from the H. W. upon the back?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite so. The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch is\n",
      "nearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch: so\n",
      "it was made for the last generation. Jewelry usually descends to the\n",
      "eldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father.\n",
      "Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has,\n",
      "therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right, so far,” said I. “Anything else?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was a man of untidy habits,—very untidy and careless. He was left\n",
      "with good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some time\n",
      "in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally,\n",
      "taking to drink, he died. That is all I can gather.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with\n",
      "considerable bitterness in my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is unworthy of you, Holmes,” I said. “I could not have believed\n",
      "that you would have descended to this. You have made inquires into the\n",
      "history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this\n",
      "knowledge in some fanciful way. You cannot expect me to believe that\n",
      "you have read all this from his old watch! It is unkind, and, to speak\n",
      "plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear doctor,” said he, kindly, “pray accept my apologies. Viewing\n",
      "the matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and\n",
      "painful a thing it might be to you. I assure you, however, that I never\n",
      "even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts?\n",
      "They are absolutely correct in every particular.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, that is good luck. I could only say what was the balance of\n",
      "probability. I did not at all expect to be so accurate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it was not mere guess-work?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no: I never guess. It is a shocking habit,—destructive to the\n",
      "logical faculty. What seems strange to you is only so because you do\n",
      "not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which\n",
      "large inferences may depend. For example, I began by stating that your\n",
      "brother was careless. When you observe the lower part of that\n",
      "watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, but it\n",
      "is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard\n",
      "objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. Surely it is no\n",
      "great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so\n",
      "cavalierly must be a careless man. Neither is it a very far-fetched\n",
      "inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty\n",
      "well provided for in other respects.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a\n",
      "watch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the\n",
      "inside of the case. It is more handy than a label, as there is no risk\n",
      "of the number being lost or transposed. There are no less than four\n",
      "such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case.\n",
      "Inference,—that your brother was often at low water. Secondary\n",
      "inference,—that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could not\n",
      "have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner\n",
      "plate, which contains the key-hole. Look at the thousands of scratches\n",
      "all round the hole,—marks where the key has slipped. What sober man’s\n",
      "key could have scored those grooves? But you will never see a\n",
      "drunkard’s watch without them. He winds it at night, and he leaves\n",
      "these traces of his unsteady hand. Where is the mystery in all this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is as clear as daylight,” I answered. “I regret the injustice which\n",
      "I did you. I should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty. May\n",
      "I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“None. Hence the cocaine. I cannot live without brain-work. What else\n",
      "is there to live for? Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary,\n",
      "dismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow fog swirls down the\n",
      "street and drifts across the dun-coloured houses. What could be more\n",
      "hopelessly prosaic and material? What is the use of having powers,\n",
      "doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them? Crime is\n",
      "commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those\n",
      "which are commonplace have any function upon earth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade, when with a crisp knock\n",
      "our landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Miss Mary Morstan,” he read. “Hum! I have no recollection of the name.\n",

      "\n",
      "Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure\n",
      "of manner. She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved, and\n",
      "dressed in the most perfect taste. There was, however, a plainness and\n",
      "simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited\n",
      "means. The dress was a sombre greyish beige, untrimmed and unbraided,\n",
      "and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue, relieved only by a\n",
      "suspicion of white feather in the side. Her face had neither regularity\n",
      "of feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was sweet and\n",
      "amiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and\n",
      "sympathetic. In an experience of women which extends over many nations\n",
      "and three separate continents, I have never looked upon a face which\n",
      "gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature. I could not\n",
      "but observe that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed for\n",
      "her, her lip trembled, her hand quivered, and she showed every sign of\n",
      "intense inward agitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have come to you, Mr. Holmes,” she said, “because you once enabled\n",
      "my employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, to unravel a little domestic\n",
      "complication. She was much impressed by your kindness and skill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Cecil Forrester,” he repeated thoughtfully. “I believe that I was\n",
      "of some slight service to her. The case, however, as I remember it, was\n",
      "a very simple one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She did not think so. But at least you cannot say the same of mine. I\n",
      "can hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly inexplicable,\n",
      "than the situation in which I find myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes rubbed his hands, and his eyes glistened. He leaned forward in\n",
      "his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his\n",
      "clear-cut, hawklike features. “State your case,” said he, in brisk,\n",
      "business tones.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt that my position was an embarrassing one. “You will, I am sure,\n",
      "excuse me,” I said, rising from my chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "To my surprise, the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me.\n",
      "“If your friend,” she said, “would be good enough to stop, he might be\n",
      "of inestimable service to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I relapsed into my chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Briefly,” she continued, “the facts are these. My father was an\n",
      "officer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite a\n",
      "child. My mother was dead, and I had no relative in England. I was\n",
      "placed, however, in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh,\n",
      "and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age. In the year\n",
      "1878 my father, who was senior captain of his regiment, obtained twelve\n",
      "months’ leave and came home. He telegraphed to me from London that he\n",
      "had arrived all safe, and directed me to come down at once, giving the\n",
      "Langham Hotel as his address. His message, as I remember, was full of\n",
      "kindness and love. On reaching London I drove to the Langham, and was\n",
      "informed that Captain Morstan was staying there, but that he had gone\n",
      "out the night before and had not yet returned. I waited all day without\n",
      "news of him. That night, on the advice of the manager of the hotel, I\n",
      "communicated with the police, and next morning we advertised in all the\n",
      "papers. Our inquiries led to no result; and from that day to this no\n",
      "word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father. He came home with\n",
      "his heart full of hope, to find some peace, some comfort, and instead—”\n",
      "She put her hand to her throat, and a choking sob cut short the\n",
      "sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The date?” asked Holmes, opening his note-book.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He disappeared upon the 3rd of December, 1878,—nearly ten years ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“His luggage?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Remained at the hotel. There was nothing in it to suggest a clue,—some\n",
      "clothes, some books, and a considerable number of curiosities from the\n",
      "Andaman Islands. He had been one of the officers in charge of the\n",
      "convict-guard there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Had he any friends in town?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only one that we know of,—Major Sholto, of his own regiment, the 34th\n",
      "Bombay Infantry. The major had retired some little time before, and\n",
      "lived at Upper Norwood. We communicated with him, of course, but he did\n",
      "not even know that his brother officer was in England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A singular case,” remarked Holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not yet described to you the most singular part. About six\n",
      "years ago—to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882—an advertisement\n",
      "appeared in the _Times_ asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and\n",
      "stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward. There was no\n",
      "name or address appended. I had at that time just entered the family of\n",
      "Mrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess. By her advice I\n",
      "published my address in the advertisement column. The same day there\n",
      "arrived through the post a small card-board box addressed to me, which\n",
      "I found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl. No word of writing\n",
      "was enclosed. Since then every year upon the same date there has always\n",
      "appeared a similar box, containing a similar pearl, without any clue as\n",
      "to the sender. They have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rare\n",
      "variety and of considerable value. You can see for yourselves that they\n",
      "are very handsome.” She opened a flat box as she spoke, and showed me\n",
      "six of the finest pearls that I had ever seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your statement is most interesting,” said Sherlock Holmes. “Has\n",
      "anything else occurred to you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, and no later than to-day. That is why I have come to you. This\n",
      "morning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for\n",
      "yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you,” said Holmes. “The envelope too, please. Postmark, London,\n",
      "S.W. Date, July 7. Hum! Man’s thumb-mark on corner,—probably postman.\n",
      "Best quality paper. Envelopes at sixpence a packet. Particular man in\n",
      "his stationery. No address. ‘Be at the third pillar from the left\n",
      "outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o’clock. If you are\n",
      "distrustful, bring two friends. You are a wronged woman, and shall have\n",
      "justice. Do not bring police. If you do, all will be in vain. Your\n",
      "unknown friend.’ Well, really, this is a very pretty little mystery.\n",
      "What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is exactly what I want to ask you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then we shall most certainly go. You and I and—yes, why, Dr. Watson is\n",
      "the very man. Your correspondent says two friends. He and I have worked\n",
      "together before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But would he come?” she asked, with something appealing in her voice\n",
      "and expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should be proud and happy,” said I, fervently, “if I can be of any\n",
      "service.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are both very kind,” she answered. “I have led a retired life, and\n",
      "have no friends whom I could appeal to. If I am here at six it will do,\n",
      "I suppose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must not be later,” said Holmes. “There is one other point,\n",
      "however. Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box\n",
      "addresses?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have them here,” she answered, producing half a dozen pieces of\n",
      "paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are certainly a model client. You have the correct intuition. Let\n",
      "us see, now.” He spread out the papers upon the table, and gave little\n",
      "darting glances from one to the other. “They are disguised hands,\n",
      "except the letter,” he said, presently, “but there can be no question\n",
      "as to the authorship. See how the irrepressible Greek _e_ will break\n",
      "out, and see the twirl of the final _s_. They are undoubtedly by the\n",
      "same person. I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan,\n",
      "but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your\n",
      "father?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing could be more unlike.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I expected to hear you say so. We shall look out for you, then, at\n",
      "six. Pray allow me to keep the papers. I may look into the matter\n",
      "before then. It is only half-past three. _Au revoir_, then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Au revoir_,” said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from\n",
      "one to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and\n",
      "hurried away. Standing at the window, I watched her walking briskly\n",
      "down the street, until the grey turban and white feather were but a\n",
      "speck in the sombre crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a very attractive woman!” I exclaimed, turning to my companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had lit his pipe again, and was leaning back with drooping eyelids.\n",
      "“Is she?” he said, languidly. “I did not observe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You really are an automaton,—a calculating-machine!” I cried. “There\n",
      "is something positively inhuman in you at times.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He smiled gently. “It is of the first importance,” he said, “not to\n",
      "allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities. A client is to\n",
      "me a mere unit,—a factor in a problem. The emotional qualities are\n",
      "antagonistic to clear reasoning. I assure you that the most winning\n",
      "woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for\n",
      "their insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is\n",
      "a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the\n",
      "London poor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In this case, however—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never make exceptions. An exception disproves the rule. Have you\n",
      "ever had occasion to study character in handwriting? What do you make\n",
      "of this fellow’s scribble?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is legible and regular,” I answered. “A man of business habits and\n",
      "some force of character.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes shook his head. “Look at his long letters,” he said. “They\n",
      "hardly rise above the common herd. That _d_ might be an _a_, and that\n",
      "_l_ an _e_. Men of character always differentiate their long letters,\n",
      "however illegibly they may write. There is vacillation in his _k_’s and\n",
      "self-esteem in his capitals. I am going out now. I have some few\n",
      "references to make. Let me recommend this book,—one of the most\n",
      "remarkable ever penned. It is Winwood Reade’s ‘Martyrdom of Man.’ I\n",
      "shall be back in an hour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts were\n",
      "far from the daring speculations of the writer. My mind ran upon our\n",
      "late visitor,—her smiles, the deep rich tones of her voice, the strange\n",
      "mystery which overhung her life. If she were seventeen at the time of\n",
      "her father’s disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now,—a sweet\n",
      "age, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little\n",
      "sobered by experience. So I sat and mused, until such dangerous\n",
      "thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged\n",
      "furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology. What was I, an army\n",
      "surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account, that I should\n",
      "dare to think of such things? She was a unit, a factor,—nothing more.\n",
      "If my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man\n",
      "than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o’-the-wisps of the\n",
      "imagination.\n",

      "In Quest of a Solution\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was half-past five before Holmes returned. He was bright, eager, and\n",
      "in excellent spirits,—a mood which in his case alternated with fits of\n",
      "the blackest depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no great mystery in this matter,” he said, taking the cup of\n",
      "tea which I had poured out for him. “The facts appear to admit of only\n",
      "one explanation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! you have solved it already?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestive\n",
      "fact, that is all. It is, however, _very_ suggestive. The details are\n",
      "still to be added. I have just found, on consulting the back files of\n",
      "the _Times_, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norword, late of the 34th\n",
      "Bombay Infantry, died upon the 28th of April, 1882.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No? You surprise me. Look at it in this way, then. Captain Morstan\n",
      "disappears. The only person in London whom he could have visited is\n",
      "Major Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London.\n",
      "Four years later Sholto dies. _Within a week of his death_ Captain\n",
      "Morstan’s daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from\n",
      "year to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a\n",
      "wronged woman. What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of\n",
      "her father? And why should the presents begin immediately after\n",
      "Sholto’s death, unless it is that Sholto’s heir knows something of the\n",
      "mystery and desires to make compensation? Have you any alternative\n",
      "theory which will meet the facts?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what a strange compensation! And how strangely made! Why, too,\n",
      "should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, the\n",
      "letter speaks of giving her justice. What justice can she have? It is\n",
      "too much to suppose that her father is still alive. There is no other\n",
      "injustice in her case that you know of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties,” said\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes, pensively. “But our expedition of to-night will solve\n",
      "them all. Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside. Are\n",
      "you all ready? Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the\n",
      "hour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes\n",
      "took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket. It\n",
      "was clear that he thought that our night’s work might be a serious one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was\n",
      "composed, but pale. She must have been more than woman if she did not\n",
      "feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were\n",
      "embarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered\n",
      "the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa’s,” she said. “His\n",
      "letters were full of allusions to the major. He and papa were in\n",
      "command of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown a\n",
      "great deal together. By the way, a curious paper was found in papa’s\n",
      "desk which no one could understand. I don’t suppose that it is of the\n",
      "slightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I\n",
      "brought it with me. It is here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee.\n",
      "He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is paper of native Indian manufacture,” he remarked. “It has at\n",
      "some time been pinned to a board. The diagram upon it appears to be a\n",
      "plan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and\n",
      "passages. At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it\n",
      "is ‘3.37 from left,’ in faded pencil-writing. In the left-hand corner\n",
      "is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms\n",
      "touching. Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters,\n",
      "‘The sign of the four,—Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan,\n",
      "Dost Akbar.’ No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the\n",
      "matter. Yet it is evidently a document of importance. It has been kept\n",
      "carefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean as the other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was in his pocket-book that we found it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of\n",
      "use to us. I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much\n",
      "deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider my\n",
      "ideas.” He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow\n",
      "and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently. Miss Morstan and I\n",
      "chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible\n",
      "outcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until\n",
      "the end of our journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a September evening, and not yet seven o’clock, but the day had\n",
      "been a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city.\n",
      "Mud-coloured clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets. Down the\n",
      "Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw\n",
      "a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellow glare\n",
      "from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air, and\n",
      "threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare. There\n",
      "was, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless\n",
      "procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of\n",
      "light,—sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. Like all human kind, they\n",
      "flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once\n",
      "more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening,\n",
      "with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to make\n",
      "me nervous and depressed. I could see from Miss Morstan’s manner that\n",
      "she was suffering from the same feeling. Holmes alone could rise\n",
      "superior to petty influences. He held his open note-book upon his knee,\n",
      "and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light\n",
      "of his pocket-lantern.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the\n",
      "side-entrances. In front a continuous stream of hansoms and\n",
      "four-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of\n",
      "shirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women. We had hardly\n",
      "reached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small,\n",
      "dark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us.\n",
      "“You will excuse me, miss,” he said with a certain dogged manner, “but\n",
      "I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions\n",
      "is a police-officer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I give you my word on that,” she answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across a\n",
      "four-wheeler and opened the door. The man who had addressed us mounted\n",
      "to the box, while we took our places inside. We had hardly done so\n",
      "before the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a\n",
      "furious pace through the foggy streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation was a curious one. We were driving to an unknown place,\n",
      "on an unknown errand. Yet our invitation was either a complete\n",
      "hoax,—which was an inconceivable hypothesis,—or else we had good reason\n",
      "to think that important issues might hang upon our journey. Miss\n",
      "Morstan’s demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever. I endeavored\n",
      "to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in\n",
      "Afghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our\n",
      "situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were\n",
      "slightly involved. To this day she declares that I told her one moving\n",
      "anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night,\n",
      "and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it. At first I had some\n",
      "idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what with\n",

      "and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner. Then came rows of\n",
      "two-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden, and then\n",
      "again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings,—the monster\n",
      "tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country. At\n",
      "last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace. None of the\n",
      "other houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped was as dark\n",
      "as its neighbours, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window. On\n",
      "our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindoo\n",
      "servant clad in a yellow turban, white loose-fitting clothes, and a\n",

      "We followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill-lit and\n",
      "worse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threw\n",
      "open. A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre\n",
      "of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle\n",
      "of red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp which\n",
      "shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees. He writhed\n",
      "his hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetual\n",
      "jerk, now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose.\n",
      "Nature had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow\n",
      "and irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly\n",
      "passing his hand over the lower part of his face. In spite of his\n",
      "obtrusive baldness, he gave the impression of youth. In point of fact\n",

      "howling desert of South London.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he\n",

      "amber-and-black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly\n",
      "into it, as into a bed of moss. Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart it\n",
      "increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah which\n",
      "stood upon a mat in the corner. A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove\n",
      "was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the\n",
      "room. As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odour.\n",

      "\n",
      "“You will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,” he remarked, airily. “I am\n",
      "a great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that valve. I am\n",
      "delighted to hear that they are unwarranted. Had your father, Miss\n",

      "I could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at this\n",
      "callous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter. Miss Morstan\n",

      "can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew. But let us have no\n",
      "outsiders,—no police or officials. We can settle everything\n",
      "satisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference. Nothing would\n",

      "a flask? No? Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to\n",
      "tobacco-smoke, to the mild balsamic odour of the Eastern tobacco. I am\n",
      "a little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative.” He\n",
      "applied a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubbled merrily\n",
      "through the rose-water. We sat all three in a semi-circle, with our\n",
      "heads advanced, and our chins upon our hands, while the strange, jerky\n",

      "liberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man\n",
      "Williams might be able to see you first. I have complete confidence in\n",
      "his discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceed\n",
      "no further in the matter. You will excuse these precautions, but I am a\n",
      "man of somewhat retiring, and I might even say refined, tastes, and\n",
      "there is nothing more unæsthetic than a policeman. I have a natural\n",
      "shrinking from all forms of rough materialism. I seldom come in contact\n",
      "with the rough crowd. I live, as you see, with some little atmosphere\n",
      "of elegance around me. I may call myself a patron of the arts. It is my\n",
      "weakness. The landscape is a genuine Corot, and, though a connoisseur\n",
      "might perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa, there cannot be\n",

      "\n",
      "“At the best it must take some time,” he answered; “for we shall\n",
      "certainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew. We shall\n",
      "all go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew. He is\n",
      "very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me.\n",

      "way. No, I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each\n",
      "other. In the first place, I must tell you that there are several\n",

      "Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood. He had prospered in India, and\n",
      "brought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collection\n",
      "of valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants. With these\n",
      "advantages he bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury. My\n",
      "twin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I very well remember the sensation which was caused by the\n",
      "disappearance of Captain Morstan. We read the details in the papers,\n",
      "and, knowing that he had been a friend of our father’s, we discussed\n",
      "the case freely in his presence. He used to join in our speculations as\n",
      "to what could have happened. Never for an instant did we suspect that\n",
      "he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast,—that of all men he\n",
      "alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We did know, however, that some mystery—some positive danger—overhung\n",
      "our father. He was very fearful of going out alone, and he always\n",
      "employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at Pondicherry Lodge.\n",
      "Williams, who drove you to-night, was one of them. He was once\n",
      "light-weight champion of England. Our father would never tell us what\n",
      "it was he feared, but he had a most marked aversion to men with wooden\n",
      "legs. On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden-legged\n",
      "man, who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders. We\n",
      "had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up. My brother and I used to\n",
      "think this a mere whim of my father’s, but events have since led us to\n",
      "change our opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great\n",
      "shock to him. He nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he opened\n",
      "it, and from that day he sickened to his death. What was in the letter\n",
      "we could never discover, but I could see as he held it that it was\n",
      "short and written in a scrawling hand. He had suffered for years from\n",
      "an enlarged spleen, but he now became rapidly worse, and towards the\n",
      "end of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope, and that he\n",
      "wished to make a last communication to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing\n",
      "heavily. He besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side\n",
      "of the bed. Then, grasping our hands, he made a remarkable statement to\n",
      "us, in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain. I shall\n",
      "try and give it to you in his own very words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘I have only one thing,’ he said, ‘which weighs upon my mind at this\n",
      "supreme moment. It is my treatment of poor Morstan’s orphan. The cursed\n",
      "greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from\n",
      "her the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers. And yet\n",
      "I have made no use of it myself,—so blind and foolish a thing is\n",
      "avarice. The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that I\n",
      "could not bear to share it with another. See that chaplet dipped with\n",
      "pearls beside the quinine-bottle. Even that I could not bear to part\n",
      "with, although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her.\n",
      "You, my sons, will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure. But send\n",
      "her nothing—not even the chaplet—until I am gone. After all, men have\n",
      "been as bad as this and have recovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘I will tell you how Morstan died,’ he continued. ‘He had suffered for\n",
      "years from a weak heart, but he concealed it from every one. I alone\n",
      "knew it. When in India, he and I, through a remarkable chain of\n",
      "circumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure. I\n",
      "brought it over to England, and on the night of Morstan’s arrival he\n",
      "came straight over here to claim his share. He walked over from the\n",
      "station, and was admitted by my faithful old Lal Chowdar, who is now\n",
      "dead. Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of\n",
      "the treasure, and we came to heated words. Morstan had sprung out of\n",
      "his chair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his hand to\n",
      "his side, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backwards, cutting\n",
      "his head against the corner of the treasure-chest. When I stooped over\n",
      "him I found, to my horror, that he was dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘For a long time I sat half distracted, wondering what I should do. My\n",
      "first impulse was, of course, to call for assistance; but I could not\n",
      "but recognise that there was every chance that I would be accused of\n",
      "his murder. His death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash in his\n",
      "head, would be black against me. Again, an official inquiry could not\n",
      "be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure, which I was\n",
      "particularly anxious to keep secret. He had told me that no soul upon\n",
      "earth knew where he had gone. There seemed to be no necessity why any\n",
      "soul ever should know.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘I was still pondering over the matter, when, looking up, I saw my\n",
      "servant, Lal Chowdar, in the doorway. He stole in and bolted the door\n",
      "behind him. “Do not fear, Sahib,” he said. “No one need know that you\n",
      "have killed him. Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?” “I did\n",
      "not kill him,” said I. Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled. “I heard\n",
      "it all, Sahib,” said he. “I heard you quarrel, and I heard the blow.\n",
      "But my lips are sealed. All are asleep in the house. Let us put him\n",
      "away together.” That was enough to decide me. If my own servant could\n",
      "not believe my innocence, how could I hope to make it good before\n",
      "twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box? Lal Chowdar and I disposed of\n",
      "the body that night, and within a few days the London papers were full\n",
      "of the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan. You will see from\n",
      "what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter. My fault lies in\n",
      "the fact that we concealed not only the body, but also the treasure,\n",
      "and that I have clung to Morstan’s share as well as to my own. I wish\n",
      "you, therefore, to make restitution. Put your ears down to my mouth.\n",
      "The treasure is hidden in—’\n",
      "\n",
      "“At this instant a horrible change came over his expression; his eyes\n",
      "stared wildly, his jaw dropped, and he yelled, in a voice which I can\n",
      "never forget, ‘Keep him out! For Christ’s sake keep him out!’ We both\n",
      "stared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed. A\n",
      "face was looking in at us out of the darkness. We could see the\n",
      "whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass. It was a\n",
      "bearded, hairy face, with wild cruel eyes and an expression of\n",
      "concentrated malevolence. My brother and I rushed towards the window,\n",
      "but the man was gone. When we returned to my father his head had\n",
      "dropped and his pulse had ceased to beat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We searched the garden that night, but found no sign of the intruder,\n",
      "save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the\n",
      "flower-bed. But for that one trace, we might have thought that our\n",
      "imaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face. We soon, however,\n",
      "had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies\n",
      "at work all round us. The window of my father’s room was found open in\n",
      "the morning, his cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon his\n",
      "chest was fixed a torn piece of paper, with the words ‘The sign of the\n",
      "four’ scrawled across it. What the phrase meant, or who our secret\n",
      "visitor may have been, we never knew. As far as we can judge, none of\n",
      "my father’s property had been actually stolen, though everything had\n",
      "been turned out. My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar\n",
      "incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life; but it\n",
      "is still a complete mystery to us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfully\n",
      "for a few moments. We had all sat absorbed, listening to his\n",
      "extraordinary narrative. At the short account of her father’s death\n",
      "Miss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared that\n",
      "she was about to faint. She rallied however, on drinking a glass of\n",
      "water which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon\n",
      "the side-table. Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an\n",
      "abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes.\n",
      "As I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he had\n",
      "complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life. Here at least was a\n",
      "problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost. Mr. Thaddeus Sholto\n",
      "looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect\n",
      "which his story had produced, and then continued between the puffs of\n",
      "his overgrown pipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My brother and I,” said he, “were, as you may imagine, much excited as\n",
      "to the treasure which my father had spoken of. For weeks and for months\n",
      "we dug and delved in every part of the garden, without discovering its\n",
      "whereabouts. It was maddening to think that the hiding-place was on his\n",
      "very lips at the moment that he died. We could judge the splendour of\n",
      "the missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out. Over this\n",
      "chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some little discussion. The\n",
      "pearls were evidently of great value, and he was averse to part with\n",
      "them, for, between friends, my brother was himself a little inclined to\n",
      "my father’s fault. He thought, too, that if we parted with the chaplet\n",
      "it might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble. It was\n",
      "all that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan’s\n",
      "address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals, so that at\n",
      "least she might never feel destitute.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a kindly thought,” said our companion, earnestly. “It was\n",
      "extremely good of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The little man waved his hand deprecatingly. “We were your trustees,”\n",
      "he said. “That was the view which I took of it, though Brother\n",
      "Bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light. We had plenty of\n",
      "money ourselves. I desired no more. Besides, it would have been such\n",
      "bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion. ‘Le\n",
      "mauvais goût mène au crime.’ The French have a very neat way of putting\n",
      "these things. Our difference of opinion on this subject went so far\n",
      "that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself: so I left\n",
      "Pondicherry Lodge, taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me.\n",
      "Yesterday, however, I learn that an event of extreme importance has\n",
      "occurred. The treasure has been discovered. I instantly communicated\n",
      "with Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood\n",
      "and demand our share. I explained my views last night to Brother\n",
      "Bartholomew: so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his luxurious settee.\n",
      "We all remained silent, with our thoughts upon the new development\n",

      "to his feet.\n",

      "light upon that which is still dark to you. But, as Miss Morstan\n",
      "remarked just now, it is late, and we had best put the matter through\n",
      "without delay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his\n",
      "hookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged\n",
      "topcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs. This he buttoned tightly up,\n",
      "in spite of the extreme closeness of the night, and finished his attire\n",
      "by putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the\n",
      "ears, so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky\n",
      "face. “My health is somewhat fragile,” he remarked, as he led the way\n",
      "down the passage. “I am compelled to be a valetudinarian.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Our cab was awaiting us outside, and our programme was evidently\n",
      "prearranged, for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace.\n",
      "Thaddeus Sholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose high above\n",
      "the rattle of the wheels.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bartholomew is a clever fellow,” said he. “How do you think he found\n",
      "out where the treasure was? He had come to the conclusion that it was\n",
      "somewhere indoors: so he worked out all the cubic space of the house,\n",
      "and made measurements everywhere, so that not one inch should be\n",
      "unaccounted for. Among other things, he found that the height of the\n",
      "building was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights of\n",
      "all the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the space\n",
      "between, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring the total\n",
      "to more than seventy feet. There were four feet unaccounted for. These\n",
      "could only be at the top of the building. He knocked a hole, therefore,\n",
      "in the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room, and there, sure\n",
      "enough, he came upon another little garret above it, which had been\n",
      "sealed up and was known to no one. In the centre stood the\n",
      "treasure-chest, resting upon two rafters. He lowered it through the\n",
      "hole, and there it lies. He computes the value of the jewels at not\n",
      "less than half a million sterling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another\n",
      "open-eyed. Miss Morstan, could we secure her rights, would change from\n",
      "a needy governess to the richest heiress in England. Surely it was the\n",
      "place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed to\n",
      "say that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned as\n",
      "heavy as lead within me. I stammered out some few halting words of\n",
      "congratulation, and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to\n",
      "the babble of our new acquaintance. He was clearly a confirmed\n",
      "hypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth\n",
      "interminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the\n",
      "composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums, some of which he\n",
      "bore about in a leather case in his pocket. I trust that he may not\n",
      "remember any of the answers which I gave him that night. Holmes\n",
      "declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of\n",
      "taking more than two drops of castor oil, while I recommended\n",
      "strychnine in large doses as a sedative. However that may be, I was\n",
      "certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman\n",
      "sprang down to open the door.\n",

      "It was nearly eleven o’clock when we reached this final stage of our\n",
      "night’s adventures. We had left the damp fog of the great city behind\n",
      "us, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from the westward,\n",
      "and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping\n",
      "occasionally through the rifts. It was clear enough to see for some\n",
      "distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the\n",
      "carriage to give us a better light upon our way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with a\n",
      "very high stone wall topped with broken glass. A single narrow\n",
      "iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guide\n",
      "knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is there?” cried a gruff voice from within.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is I, McMurdo. You surely know my knock by this time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys. The\n",
      "door swung heavily back, and a short, deep-chested man stood in the\n",
      "opening, with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his\n",
      "protruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That you, Mr. Thaddeus? But who are the others? I had no orders about\n",
      "them from the master.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, McMurdo? You surprise me! I told my brother last night that I\n",
      "should bring some friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He ain’t been out o’ his room to-day, Mr. Thaddeus, and I have no\n",
      "orders. You know very well that I must stick to regulations. I can let\n",
      "you in, but your friends must just stop where they are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was an unexpected obstacle. Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in a\n",
      "perplexed and helpless manner. “This is too bad of you, McMurdo!” he\n",
      "said. “If I guarantee them, that is enough for you. There is the young\n",
      "lady, too. She cannot wait on the public road at this hour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,” said the porter, inexorably. “Folk may be\n",
      "friends o’ yours, and yet no friends o’ the master’s. He pays me well\n",
      "to do my duty, and my duty I’ll do. I don’t know none o’ your friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes you do, McMurdo,” cried Sherlock Holmes, genially. “I don’t\n",
      "think you can have forgotten me. Don’t you remember the amateur who\n",
      "fought three rounds with you at Alison’s rooms on the night of your\n",
      "benefit four years back?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” roared the prize-fighter. “God’s truth! how\n",
      "could I have mistook you? If instead o’ standin’ there so quiet you had\n",
      "just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw, I’d\n",
      "ha’ known you without a question. Ah, you’re one that has wasted your\n",
      "gifts, you have! You might have aimed high, if you had joined the\n",
      "fancy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still one of the\n",
      "scientific professions open to me,” said Holmes, laughing. “Our friend\n",
      "won’t keep us out in the cold now, I am sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In you come, sir, in you come,—you and your friends,” he answered.\n",
      "“Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict. Had to be\n",
      "certain of your friends before I let them in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside, a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of\n",
      "a house, square and prosaic, all plunged in shadow save where a\n",
      "moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window. The vast\n",
      "size of the building, with its gloom and its deathly silence, struck a\n",
      "chill to the heart. Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease, and the\n",
      "lantern quivered and rattled in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot understand it,” he said. “There must be some mistake. I\n",
      "distinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here, and yet there is no\n",
      "light in his window. I do not know what to make of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does he always guard the premises in this way?” asked Holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; he has followed my father’s custom. He was the favourite son, you\n",
      "know, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than\n",
      "he ever told me. That is Bartholomew’s window up there where the\n",
      "moonshine strikes. It is quite bright, but there is no light from\n",
      "within, I think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“None,” said Holmes. “But I see the glint of a light in that little\n",
      "window beside the door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, that is the housekeeper’s room. That is where old Mrs. Bernstone\n",
      "sits. She can tell us all about it. But perhaps you would not mind\n",
      "waiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and she\n",
      "has no word of our coming she may be alarmed. But hush! what is that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He held up the lantern, and his hand shook until the circles of light\n",
      "flickered and wavered all round us. Miss Morstan seized my wrist, and\n",
      "we all stood with thumping hearts, straining our ears. From the great\n",
      "black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most\n",
      "pitiful of sounds,—the shrill, broken whimpering of a frightened woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is Mrs. Bernstone,” said Sholto. “She is the only woman in the\n",
      "house. Wait here. I shall be back in a moment.” He hurried for the\n",
      "door, and knocked in his peculiar way. We could see a tall old woman\n",
      "admit him, and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come! I am so glad you\n",
      "have come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!” We heard her reiterated rejoicings until\n",
      "the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our guide had left us the lantern. Holmes swung it slowly round, and\n",
      "peered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps which\n",
      "cumbered the grounds. Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand\n",
      "was in mine. A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who\n",
      "had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even\n",
      "look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble\n",
      "our hands instinctively sought for each other. I have marvelled at it\n",
      "since, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should\n",
      "go out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her also\n",
      "the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection. So we stood hand\n",
      "in hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for all\n",
      "the dark things that surrounded us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a strange place!” she said, looking round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it.\n",
      "I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat,\n",
      "where the prospectors had been at work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And from the same cause,” said Holmes. “These are the traces of the\n",
      "treasure-seekers. You must remember that they were six years looking\n",
      "for it. No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholto\n",
      "came running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is something amiss with Bartholomew!” he cried. “I am\n",
      "frightened! My nerves cannot stand it.” He was, indeed, half blubbering\n",
      "with fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out from the great\n",
      "Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a terrified\n",
      "child.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come into the house,” said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, do!” pleaded Thaddeus Sholto. “I really do not feel equal to\n",
      "giving directions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We all followed him into the housekeeper’s room, which stood upon the\n",
      "left-hand side of the passage. The old woman was pacing up and down\n",
      "with a scared look and restless picking fingers, but the sight of Miss\n",
      "Morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“God bless your sweet calm face!” she cried, with an hysterical sob.\n",
      "“It does me good to see you. Oh, but I have been sorely tried this\n",
      "day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Our companion patted her thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some few\n",
      "words of kindly womanly comfort which brought the colour back into the\n",
      "other’s bloodless cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Master has locked himself in and will not answer me,” she explained.\n",
      "“All day I have waited to hear from him, for he often likes to be\n",
      "alone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I went up\n",
      "and peeped through the key-hole. You must go up, Mr. Thaddeus,—you must\n",
      "go up and look for yourself. I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto in joy\n",
      "and in sorrow for ten long years, but I never saw him with such a face\n",
      "on him as that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto’s\n",
      "teeth were chattering in his head. So shaken was he that I had to pass\n",
      "my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees were\n",
      "trembling under him. Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out\n",
      "of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be\n",
      "mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served\n",
      "as a stair-carpet. He walked slowly from step to step, holding the\n",
      "lamp, and shooting keen glances to right and left. Miss Morstan had\n",
      "remained behind with the frightened housekeeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length,\n",
      "with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three\n",
      "doors upon the left. Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and\n",
      "methodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our long black\n",
      "shadows streaming backwards down the corridor. The third door was that\n",
      "which we were seeking. Holmes knocked without receiving any answer, and\n",
      "then tried to turn the handle and force it open. It was locked on the\n",
      "inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see when\n",
      "we set our lamp up against it. The key being turned, however, the hole\n",
      "was not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmes bent down to it, and instantly\n",
      "rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is something devilish in this, Watson,” said he, more moved than\n",
      "I had ever before seen him. “What do you make of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. Moonlight was streaming\n",
      "into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance.\n",
      "Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all\n",
      "beneath was in shadow, there hung a face,—the very face of our\n",
      "companion Thaddeus. There was the same high, shining head, the same\n",
      "circular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance. The\n",
      "features were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural\n",
      "grin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the\n",
      "nerves than any scowl or contortion. So like was the face to that of\n",
      "our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was\n",
      "indeed with us. Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us\n",
      "that his brother and he were twins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is terrible!” I said to Holmes. “What is to be done?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The door must come down,” he answered, and, springing against it, he\n",
      "put all his weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did not\n",
      "yield. Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time it\n",
      "gave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew\n",
      "Sholto’s chamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. A double\n",
      "line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the\n",
      "door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners, test-tubes,\n",
      "and retorts. In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets.\n",
      "One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of\n",
      "dark-coloured liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy\n",
      "with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odour. A set of steps stood at one\n",
      "side of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster, and\n",
      "above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man\n",
      "to pass through. At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was\n",
      "thrown carelessly together.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was seated\n",
      "all in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and that\n",
      "ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. He was stiff and cold, and\n",
      "had clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not only his\n",
      "features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most\n",
      "fantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar\n",
      "instrument,—a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a\n",
      "hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a torn sheet\n",
      "of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced at it,\n",
      "and then handed it to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see,” he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, “The sign\n",
      "of the four.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In God’s name, what does it all mean?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It means murder,” said he, stooping over the dead man. “Ah, I expected\n",
      "it. Look here!” He pointed to what looked like a long, dark thorn stuck\n",
      "in the skin just above the ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It looks like a thorn,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a thorn. You may pick it out. But be careful, for it is\n",
      "poisoned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I took it up between my finger and thumb. It came away from the skin so\n",
      "readily that hardly any mark was left behind. One tiny speck of blood\n",
      "showed where the puncture had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is all an insoluble mystery to me,” said I. “It grows darker\n",
      "instead of clearer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the contrary,” he answered, “it clears every instant. I only\n",
      "require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We had almost forgotten our companion’s presence since we entered the\n",
      "chamber. He was still standing in the doorway, the very picture of\n",
      "terror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself. Suddenly, however,\n",
      "he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The treasure is gone!” he said. “They have robbed him of the treasure!\n",
      "There is the hole through which we lowered it. I helped him to do it! I\n",
      "was the last person who saw him! I left him here last night, and I\n",
      "heard him lock the door as I came downstairs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What time was that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was ten o’clock. And now he is dead, and the police will be called\n",
      "in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am\n",
      "sure I shall. But you don’t think so, gentlemen? Surely you don’t think\n",
      "that it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it\n",
      "were I? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!” He jerked his\n",
      "arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,” said Holmes, kindly, putting\n",
      "his hand upon his shoulder. “Take my advice, and drive down to the\n",
      "station to report this matter to the police. Offer to assist them in\n",
      "every way. We shall wait here until your return.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him\n",

      "almost complete; but we must not err on the side of over-confidence.\n",

      "to it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but addressing them\n",
      "to himself rather than to me. “Window is snibbed on the inner side.\n",
      "Framework is solid. No hinges at the side. Let us open it. No\n",
      "water-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a man has mounted by the\n",
      "window. It rained a little last night. Here is the print of a foot in\n",
      "mould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy mark, and here again\n",
      "upon the floor, and here again by the table. See here, Watson! This is\n",
      "really a very pretty demonstration.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs. “This is not a\n",
      "footmark,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a\n",
      "wooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot\n",
      "with the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the\n",
      "timber-toe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is the wooden-legged man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite so. But there has been some one else,—a very able and efficient\n",
      "ally. Could you scale that wall, doctor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked out of the open window. The moon still shone brightly on that\n",
      "angle of the house. We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and,\n",
      "look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a crevice\n",
      "in the brick-work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is absolutely impossible,” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered\n",
      "you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing one end of\n",
      "it to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think, if you were an active\n",
      "man, You might swarm up, wooden leg and all. You would depart, of\n",
      "course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the rope,\n",
      "untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside, and get\n",
      "away in the way that he originally came. As a minor point it may be\n",
      "noted,” he continued, fingering the rope, “that our wooden-legged\n",
      "friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional sailor. His hands\n",
      "were far from horny. My lens discloses more than one blood-mark,\n",
      "especially towards the end of the rope, from which I gather that he\n",
      "slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is all very well,” said I, “but the thing becomes more\n",
      "unintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally? How came he\n",
      "into the room?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, the ally!” repeated Holmes, pensively. “There are features of\n",
      "interest about this ally. He lifts the case from the regions of the\n",
      "commonplace. I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals\n",
      "of crime in this country,—though parallel cases suggest themselves from\n",
      "India, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How came he, then?” I reiterated. “The door is locked, the window is\n",
      "inaccessible. Was it through the chimney?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The grate is much too small,” he answered. “I had already considered\n",
      "that possibility.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How then?” I persisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will not apply my precept,” he said, shaking his head. “How often\n",
      "have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible\n",
      "whatever remains, _however improbable_, must be the truth? We know that\n",
      "he did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We also\n",
      "know that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no\n",
      "concealment possible. Whence, then, did he come?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He came through the hole in the roof,” I cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course he did. He must have done so. If you will have the kindness\n",
      "to hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches to the room\n",
      "above,—the secret room in which the treasure was found.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he swung\n",
      "himself up into the garret. Then, lying on his face, he reached down\n",
      "for the lamp and held it while I followed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and\n",
      "six the other. The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin\n",
      "lath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from beam\n",
      "to beam. The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner shell\n",
      "of the true roof of the house. There was no furniture of any sort, and\n",
      "the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here you are, you see,” said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand against\n",
      "the sloping wall. “This is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof.\n",
      "I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping at a gentle\n",
      "angle. This, then, is the way by which Number One entered. Let us see\n",
      "if we can find any other traces of his individuality.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for the\n",
      "second time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face.\n",
      "For myself, as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes.\n",
      "The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot,—clear,\n",
      "well defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of an\n",
      "ordinary man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Holmes,” I said, in a whisper, “a child has done the horrid thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had recovered his self-possession in an instant. “I was staggered\n",
      "for the moment,” he said, “but the thing is quite natural. My memory\n",
      "failed me, or I should have been able to foretell it. There is nothing\n",
      "more to be learned here. Let us go down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?” I asked, eagerly,\n",
      "when we had regained the lower room once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself,” said he, with a touch\n",
      "of impatience. “You know my methods. Apply them, and it will be\n",
      "instructive to compare results.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts,” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will be clear enough to you soon,” he said, in an off-hand way. “I\n",
      "think that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will look.”\n",
      "He whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hurried about the room\n",
      "on his knees, measuring, comparing, examining, with his long thin nose\n",
      "only a few inches from the planks, and his beady eyes gleaming and\n",
      "deep-set like those of a bird. So swift, silent, and furtive were his\n",
      "movements, like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent,\n",
      "that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made\n",
      "had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law, instead of\n",
      "exerting them in its defence. As he hunted about, he kept muttering to\n",
      "himself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are certainly in luck,” said he. “We ought to have very little\n",
      "trouble now. Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the\n",
      "creosote. You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at\n",
      "the side of this evil-smelling mess. The carboy has been cracked, You\n",
      "see, and the stuff has leaked out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What then?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, we have got him, that’s all,” said he. “I know a dog that would\n",
      "follow that scent to the world’s end. If a pack can track a trailed\n",
      "herring across a shire, how far can a specially-trained hound follow so\n",
      "pungent a smell as this? It sounds like a sum in the rule of three. The\n",
      "answer should give us the—But halloa! here are the accredited\n",
      "representatives of the law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Heavy steps and the clamour of loud voices were audible from below, and\n",
      "the hall door shut with a loud crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Before they come,” said Holmes, “just put your hand here on this poor\n",
      "fellow’s arm, and here on his leg. What do you feel?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The muscles are as hard as a board,” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite so. They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding\n",
      "the usual _rigor mortis_. Coupled with this distortion of the face,\n",
      "this Hippocratic smile, or ‘_risus sardonicus_,’ as the old writers\n",
      "called it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid,” I answered,—“some\n",
      "strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn\n",
      "muscles of the face. On getting into the room I at once looked for the\n",
      "means by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I\n",
      "discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force\n",
      "into the scalp. You observe that the part struck was that which would\n",
      "be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his\n",
      "chair. Now examine the thorn.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It was\n",
      "long, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though\n",
      "some gummy substance had dried upon it. The blunt end had been trimmed\n",
      "and rounded off with a knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that an English thorn?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, it certainly is not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference.\n",
      "But here are the regulars; so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on\n",
      "the passage, and a very stout, portly man in a grey suit strode heavily\n",
      "into the room. He was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with a pair of\n",
      "very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen\n",
      "and puffy pouches. He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform,\n",
      "and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here’s a business!” he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. “Here’s a\n",
      "pretty business! But who are all these? Why, the house seems to be as\n",
      "full as a rabbit-warren!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones,” said Holmes,\n",
      "quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, of course I do!” he wheezed. “It’s Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the\n",
      "theorist. Remember you! I’ll never forget how you lectured us all on\n",
      "causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case. It’s\n",
      "true you set us on the right track; but you’ll own now that it was more\n",
      "by good luck than good guidance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a piece of very simple reasoning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, come, now, come! Never be ashamed to own up. But what is all this?\n",
      "Bad business! Bad business! Stern facts here,—no room for theories. How\n",
      "lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another case! I was at\n",
      "the station when the message arrived. What d’you think the man died\n",
      "of?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorise over,” said Holmes,\n",
      "dryly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no. Still, we can’t deny that you hit the nail on the head\n",
      "sometimes. Dear me! Door locked, I understand. Jewels worth half a\n",
      "million missing. How was the window?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fastened; but there are steps on the sill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with\n",
      "the matter. That’s common sense. Man might have died in a fit; but then\n",
      "the jewels are missing. Ha! I have a theory. These flashes come upon me\n",
      "at times.—Just step outside, sergeant, and you, Mr. Sholto. Your friend\n",
      "can remain.—What do you think of this, Holmes? Sholto was, on his own\n",
      "confession, with his brother last night. The brother died in a fit, on\n",
      "which Sholto walked off with the treasure. How’s that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on\n",
      "the inside.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hum! There’s a flaw there. Let us apply common sense to the matter.\n",
      "This Thaddeus Sholto _was_ with his brother; there _was_ a quarrel; so\n",
      "much we know. The brother is dead and the jewels are gone. So much also\n",
      "we know. No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him. His\n",
      "bed had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed\n",
      "state of mind. His appearance is—well, not attractive. You see that I\n",
      "am weaving my web round Thaddeus. The net begins to close upon him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are not quite in possession of the facts yet,” said Holmes. “This\n",
      "splinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned,\n",
      "was in the man’s scalp where you still see the mark; this card,\n",
      "inscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay this\n",
      "rather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all that fit into your\n",
      "theory?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Confirms it in every respect,” said the fat detective, pompously.\n",
      "“House is full of Indian curiosities. Thaddeus brought this up, and if\n",
      "this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use\n",
      "of it as any other man. The card is some hocus-pocus,—a blind, as like\n",
      "as not. The only question is, how did he depart? Ah, of course, here is\n",
      "a hole in the roof.” With great activity, considering his bulk, he\n",
      "sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, and\n",
      "immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he\n",
      "had found the trap-door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He can find something,” remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. “He\n",
      "has occasional glimmerings of reason. _Il n’y a pas des sots si\n",
      "incommodes que ceux qui ont de l’esprit!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see!” said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again.\n",
      "“Facts are better than mere theories, after all. My view of the case is\n",
      "confirmed. There is a trap-door communicating with the roof, and it is\n",
      "partly open.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was I who opened it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, indeed! You did notice it, then?” He seemed a little crestfallen\n",
      "at the discovery. “Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our gentleman\n",
      "got away. Inspector!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir,” from the passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way.—Mr. Sholto, it is my duty to inform\n",
      "you that anything which you may say will be used against you. I arrest\n",
      "you in the Queen’s name as being concerned in the death of your\n",
      "brother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, now! Didn’t I tell you!” cried the poor little man, throwing\n",
      "out his hands, and looking from one to the other of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto,” said Holmes. “I think\n",
      "that I can engage to clear you of the charge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t promise too much, Mr. Theorist,—don’t promise too much!” snapped\n",
      "the detective. “You may find it a harder matter than you think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free\n",
      "present of the name and description of one of the two people who were\n",
      "in this room last night. His name, I have every reason to believe, is\n",
      "Jonathan Small. He is a poorly-educated man, small, active, with his\n",
      "right leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the\n",
      "inner side. His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an iron\n",
      "band round the heel. He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has\n",
      "been a convict. These few indications may be of some assistance to you,\n",
      "coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from\n",
      "the palm of his hand. The other man—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! the other man—?” asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but\n",
      "impressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of the\n",
      "other’s manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is a rather curious person,” said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his\n",
      "heel. “I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair\n",
      "of them.—A word with you, Watson.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He led me out to the head of the stair. “This unexpected occurrence,”\n",
      "he said, “has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of\n",
      "our journey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have just been thinking so,” I answered. “It is not right that Miss\n",
      "Morstan should remain in this stricken house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. You must escort her home. She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester, in\n",
      "Lower Camberwell: so it is not very far. I will wait for you here if\n",
      "you will drive out again. Or perhaps you are too tired?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By no means. I don’t think I could rest until I know more of this\n",
      "fantastic business. I have seen something of the rough side of life,\n",
      "but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises\n",
      "to-night has shaken my nerve completely. I should like, however, to see\n",
      "the matter through with you, now that I have got so far.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your presence will be of great service to me,” he answered. “We shall\n",
      "work the case out independently, and leave this fellow Jones to exult\n",
      "over any mare’s-nest which he may choose to construct. When you have\n",
      "dropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go on to No. 3, Pinchin Lane, down\n",
      "near the water’s edge at Lambeth. The third house on the right-hand\n",
      "side is a bird-stuffer’s: Sherman is the name. You will see a weasel\n",
      "holding a young rabbit in the window. Knock old Sherman up, and tell\n",
      "him, with my compliments, that I want Toby at once. You will bring Toby\n",
      "back in the cab with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A dog, I suppose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,—a queer mongrel, with a most amazing power of scent. I would\n",

      "London.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall bring him, then,” said I. “It is one now. I ought to be back\n",
      "before three, if I can get a fresh horse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I,” said Holmes, “shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone,\n",
      "and from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tell me, sleeps in the\n",
      "next garret. Then I shall study the great Jones’s methods and listen to\n",

      "The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss\n",
      "Morstan back to her home. After the angelic fashion of women, she had\n",
      "borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker\n",
      "than herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the\n",
      "side of the frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however, she first\n",
      "turned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,—so sorely had\n",
      "she been tried by the adventures of the night. She has told me since\n",
      "that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey. She little\n",
      "guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint\n",
      "which held me back. My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as\n",
      "my hand had in the garden. I felt that years of the conventionalities\n",
      "of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this\n",
      "one day of strange experiences. Yet there were two thoughts which\n",
      "sealed the words of affection upon my lips. She was weak and helpless,\n",
      "shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disadvantage to\n",
      "obtrude love upon her at such a time. Worse still, she was rich. If\n",

      "fair, was it honourable, that a half-pay surgeon should take such\n",
      "advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about? Might she not\n",
      "look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker? I could not bear to risk\n",
      "that such a thought should cross her mind. This Agra treasure\n",
      "intervened like an impassable barrier between us.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was nearly two o’clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester’s. The\n",
      "servants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so\n",
      "interested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that\n",
      "she had sat up in the hope of her return. She opened the door herself,\n",
      "a middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderly\n",
      "her arm stole round the other’s waist and how motherly was the voice in\n",
      "which she greeted her. She was clearly no mere paid dependant, but an\n",
      "honoured friend. I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged\n",
      "me to step in and tell her our adventures. I explained, however, the\n",
      "importance of my errand, and promised faithfully to call and report any\n",
      "progress which we might make with the case. As we drove away I stole a\n",
      "glance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step, the\n",
      "two graceful, clinging figures, the half-opened door, the hall-light\n",
      "shining through stained glass, the barometer, and the bright\n",
      "stair-rods. It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a\n",
      "tranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had\n",
      "absorbed us.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it\n",
      "grew. I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I\n",
      "rattled on through the silent gas-lit streets. There was the original\n",
      "problem: that at least was pretty clear now. The death of Captain\n",
      "Morstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter,—we\n",
      "had had light upon all those events. They had only led us, however, to\n",
      "a deeper and far more tragic mystery. The Indian treasure, the curious\n",
      "plan found among Morstan’s baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto’s\n",
      "death, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the\n",
      "murder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the\n",
      "crime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card,\n",
      "corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan’s chart,—here was indeed\n",
      "a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my\n",
      "fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower\n",
      "quarter of Lambeth. I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I\n",
      "could make my impression. At last, however, there was the glint of a\n",
      "candle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on, you drunken vagabone,” said the face. “If you kick up any more\n",
      "row I’ll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you’ll let one out it’s just what I have come for,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on!” yelled the voice. “So help me gracious, I have a wiper in the\n",
      "bag, an’ I’ll drop it on your ’ead if you don’t hook it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I want a dog,” I cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won’t be argued with!” shouted Mr. Sherman. “Now stand clear, for\n",
      "when I say ‘three,’ down goes the wiper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Sherlock Holmes—” I began, but the words had a most magical\n",
      "effect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minute the\n",
      "door was unbarred and open. Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old man, with\n",
      "stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome,” said he. “Step in, sir.\n",
      "Keep clear of the badger; for he bites. Ah, naughty, naughty, would you\n",
      "take a nip at the gentleman?” This to a stoat which thrust its wicked\n",
      "head and red eyes between the bars of its cage. “Don’t mind that, sir:\n",
      "it’s only a slow-worm. It hain’t got no fangs, so I gives it the run o’\n",
      "the room, for it keeps the beetles down. You must not mind my bein’\n",
      "just a little short wi’ you at first, for I’m guyed at by the children,\n",
      "and there’s many a one just comes down this lane to knock me up. What\n",
      "was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He wanted a dog of yours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! that would be Toby.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Toby was the name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Toby lives at No. 7 on the left here.” He moved slowly forward with\n",
      "his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round\n",
      "him. In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were\n",
      "glancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and\n",
      "corner. Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls,\n",
      "who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices\n",
      "disturbed their slumbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toby proved to be an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, half\n",
      "spaniel and half lurcher, brown-and-white in colour, with a very clumsy\n",
      "waddling gait. It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which\n",
      "the old naturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance,\n",
      "it followed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanying\n",
      "me. It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself\n",
      "back once more at Pondicherry Lodge. The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had,\n",
      "I found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto had\n",
      "been marched off to the station. Two constables guarded the narrow\n",
      "gate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the\n",
      "detective’s name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes was standing on the door-step, with his hands in his pockets,\n",
      "smoking his pipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, you have him there!” said he. “Good dog, then! Atheney Jones has\n",
      "gone. We have had an immense display of energy since you left. He has\n",
      "arrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gatekeeper, the housekeeper,\n",
      "and the Indian servant. We have the place to ourselves, but for a\n",
      "sergeant upstairs. Leave the dog here, and come up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We tied Toby to the hall table, and re-ascended the stairs. The room\n",
      "was as he had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over the\n",
      "central figure. A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lend me your bull’s-eye, sergeant,” said my companion. “Now tie this\n",
      "bit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thank you.\n",
      "Now I must kick off my boots and stockings.—Just you carry them down\n",
      "with you, Watson. I am going to do a little climbing. And dip my\n",
      "handkerchief into the creasote. That will do. Now come up into the\n",
      "garret with me for a moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We clambered up through the hole. Holmes turned his light once more\n",
      "upon the footsteps in the dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks,” he said. “Do you\n",
      "observe anything noteworthy about them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They belong,” I said, “to a child or a small woman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Apart from their size, though. Is there nothing else?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They appear to be much as other footmarks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all. Look here! This is the print of a right foot in the dust.\n",
      "Now I make one with my naked foot beside it. What is the chief\n",
      "difference?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your toes are all cramped together. The other print has each toe\n",
      "distinctly divided.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite so. That is the point. Bear that in mind. Now, would you kindly\n",
      "step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the wood-work? I\n",
      "shall stay here, as I have this handkerchief in my hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I did as he directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry\n",
      "smell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is where he put his foot in getting out. If _you_ can trace him,\n",
      "I should think that Toby will have no difficulty. Now run downstairs,\n",
      "loose the dog, and look out for Blondin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on the\n",
      "roof, and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very\n",
      "slowly along the ridge. I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys,\n",
      "but he presently reappeared, and then vanished once more upon the\n",
      "opposite side. When I made my way round there I found him seated at one\n",
      "of the corner eaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That you, Watson?” he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the place. What is that black thing down there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A water-barrel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Top on it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No sign of a ladder?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Confound the fellow! It’s a most break-neck place. I ought to be able\n",
      "to come down where he could climb up. The water-pipe feels pretty firm.\n",
      "Here goes, anyhow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a scuffling of feet, and the lantern began to come steadily\n",
      "down the side of the wall. Then with a light spring he came on to the\n",
      "barrel, and from there to the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was easy to follow him,” he said, drawing on his stockings and\n",
      "boots. “Tiles were loosened the whole way along, and in his hurry he\n",
      "had dropped this. It confirms my diagnosis, as you doctors express it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out\n",
      "of coloured grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it. In\n",
      "shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside were half a\n",
      "dozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other,\n",
      "like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are hellish things,” said he. “Look out that you don’t prick\n",
      "yourself. I’m delighted to have them, for the chances are that they are\n",
      "all he has. There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin\n",
      "before long. I would sooner face a Martini bullet, myself. Are you game\n",
      "for a six-mile trudge, Watson?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly,” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your leg will stand it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here you are, doggy! Good old Toby! Smell it, Toby, smell it!” He\n",
      "pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog’s nose, while the\n",
      "creature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comical\n",
      "cock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the _bouquet_ of a famous\n",
      "vintage. Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a\n",
      "stout cord to the mongrel’s collar, and led him to the foot of the\n",
      "water-barrel. The creature instantly broke into a succession of high,\n",
      "tremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in the\n",
      "air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and\n",
      "kept us at the top of our speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some\n",
      "distance in the cold grey light. The square, massive house, with its\n",
      "black, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn,\n",
      "behind us. Our course led right across the grounds, in and out among\n",
      "the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected. The\n",
      "whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs, had a\n",
      "blighted, ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which\n",
      "hung over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly,\n",
      "underneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a\n",
      "young beech. Where the two walls joined, several bricks had been\n",
      "loosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the\n",
      "lower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder. Holmes\n",
      "clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over upon the\n",
      "other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s the print of wooden-leg’s hand,” he remarked, as I mounted up\n",
      "beside him. “You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster.\n",
      "What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since\n",
      "yesterday! The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their\n",
      "eight-and-twenty hours’ start.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great\n",
      "traffic which had passed along the London road in the interval. My\n",
      "fears were soon appeased, however. Toby never hesitated or swerved, but\n",
      "waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion. Clearly, the pungent smell\n",
      "of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do not imagine,” said Holmes, “that I depend for my success in this\n",
      "case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot\n",
      "in the chemical. I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace\n",
      "them in many different ways. This, however, is the readiest and, since\n",
      "fortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if I neglected\n",
      "it. It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty little\n",
      "intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. There might\n",
      "have been some credit to be gained out of it, but for this too palpable\n",
      "clue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is credit, and to spare,” said I. “I assure you, Holmes, that I\n",
      "marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even\n",
      "more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems to me to\n",
      "be deeper and more inexplicable. How, for example, could you describe\n",
      "with such confidence the wooden-legged man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself. I don’t wish to be\n",
      "theatrical. It is all patent and above-board. Two officers who are in\n",
      "command of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried\n",
      "treasure. A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan\n",
      "Small. You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain\n",
      "Morstan’s possession. He had signed it in behalf of himself and his\n",
      "associates,—the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called\n",
      "it. Aided by this chart, the officers—or one of them—gets the treasure\n",
      "and brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some condition\n",
      "under which he received it unfulfilled. Now, then, why did not Jonathan\n",
      "Small get the treasure himself? The answer is obvious. The chart is\n",
      "dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association with\n",
      "convicts. Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he and his\n",
      "associates were themselves convicts and could not get away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that is mere speculation,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is more than that. It is the only hypothesis which covers the\n",
      "facts. Let us see how it fits in with the sequel. Major Sholto remains\n",
      "at peace for some years, happy in the possession of his treasure. Then\n",
      "he receives a letter from India which gives him a great fright. What\n",
      "was that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or had escaped. That is much more likely, for he would have known what\n",
      "their term of imprisonment was. It would not have been a surprise to\n",
      "him. What does he do then? He guards himself against a wooden-legged\n",
      "man,—a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for him,\n",
      "and actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only one white man’s name is\n",
      "on the chart. The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans. There is no other\n",
      "white man. Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden-legged\n",
      "man is identical with Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike you as\n",
      "being faulty?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No: it is clear and concise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let us\n",
      "look at it from his point of view. He comes to England with the double\n",
      "idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having\n",
      "his revenge upon the man who had wronged him. He found out where Sholto\n",
      "lived, and very possibly he established communications with some one\n",
      "inside the house. There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen.\n",
      "Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could not\n",
      "find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew,\n",
      "save the major and one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly Small\n",
      "learns that the major is on his death-bed. In a frenzy lest the secret\n",
      "of the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes\n",
      "his way to the dying man’s window, and is only deterred from entering\n",
      "by the presence of his two sons. Mad with hate, however, against the\n",
      "dead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers in\n",
      "the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and\n",
      "finally leaves a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the\n",
      "card. He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major\n",
      "he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not\n",
      "a common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates,\n",
      "something in the nature of an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre\n",
      "conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, and\n",
      "usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. Do you follow\n",
      "all this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very clearly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, what could Jonathan Small do? He could only continue to keep a\n",
      "secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly he\n",
      "leaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the\n",
      "discovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it. We again\n",
      "trace the presence of some confederate in the household. Jonathan, with\n",
      "his wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of\n",
      "Bartholomew Sholto. He takes with him, however, a rather curious\n",
      "associate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into\n",
      "creasote, whence comes Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer\n",
      "with a damaged tendo Achillis.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite so. And rather to Jonathan’s disgust, to judge by the way he\n",
      "stamped about when he got into the room. He bore no grudge against\n",
      "Bartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he could have been\n",
      "simply bound and gagged. He did not wish to put his head in a halter.\n",
      "There was no help for it, however: the savage instincts of his\n",
      "companion had broken out, and the poison had done its work: so Jonathan\n",
      "Small left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground, and\n",
      "followed it himself. That was the train of events as far as I can\n",
      "decipher them. Of course as to his personal appearance he must be\n",
      "middle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an\n",
      "oven as the Andamans. His height is readily calculated from the length\n",
      "of his stride, and we know that he was bearded. His hairiness was the\n",
      "one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him\n",
      "at the window. I don’t know that there is anything else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The associate?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, well, there is no great mystery in that. But you will know all\n",
      "about it soon enough. How sweet the morning air is! See how that one\n",
      "little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo.\n",
      "Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank. It\n",
      "shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a\n",
      "stranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty\n",
      "ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces\n",
      "of nature! Are you well up in your Jean Paul?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fairly so. I worked back to him through Carlyle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was like following the brook to the parent lake. He makes one\n",
      "curious but profound remark. It is that the chief proof of man’s real\n",
      "greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. It argues, you\n",
      "see, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a\n",
      "proof of nobility. There is much food for thought in Richter. You have\n",
      "not a pistol, have you?”\n",
      "\n",

      "however, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, where\n",
      "labourers and dockmen were already astir, and slatternly women were\n",
      "taking down shutters and brushing door-steps. At the square-topped\n",
      "corner public houses business was just beginning, and rough-looking men\n",
      "were emerging, rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their\n",
      "morning wet. Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as\n",
      "we passed, but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor to\n",
      "the left, but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an\n",
      "occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now found\n",
      "ourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through the\n",
      "side-streets to the east of the Oval. The men whom we pursued seemed to\n",
      "have taken a curiously zigzag road, with the idea probably of escaping\n",
      "observation. They had never kept to the main road if a parallel\n",
      "side-street would serve their turn. At the foot of Kennington Lane they\n",
      "had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street. Where\n",
      "the latter street turns into Knight’s Place, Toby ceased to advance,\n",
      "but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the\n",
      "other drooping, the very picture of canine indecision. Then he waddled\n",
      "round in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to ask for\n",
      "sympathy in his embarrassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the deuce is the matter with the dog?” growled Holmes. “They\n",

      "\n",
      "“Perhaps they stood here for some time,” I suggested.\n",

      "“Ah! it’s all right. He’s off again,” said my companion, in a tone of\n",
      "relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up\n",
      "his mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he\n",
      "had not yet shown. The scent appeared to be much hotter than before,\n",
      "for he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at his\n",
      "leash and tried to break into a run. I could see by the gleam in\n",
      "Holmes’s eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and\n",
      "Nelson’s large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern. Here the\n",
      "dog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side-gate into\n",
      "the enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work. On the dog raced\n",
      "through sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a passage, between\n",
      "two wood-piles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprang upon a\n",
      "large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had\n",
      "been brought. With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood upon\n",
      "the cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of\n",
      "appreciation. The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley\n",
      "were smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the\n",
      "smell of creasote.\n",

      "\n",
      "“He acted according to his lights,” said Holmes, lifting him down from\n",
      "the barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard. “If you consider how\n",
      "much creasote is carted about London in one day, it is no great wonder\n",
      "that our trail should have been crossed. It is much used now,\n",
      "especially for the seasoning of wood. Poor Toby is not to blame.”\n",

      "“We must get on the main scent again, I suppose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. And, fortunately, we have no distance to go. Evidently what\n",
      "puzzled the dog at the corner of Knight’s Place was that there were two\n",

      "It only remains to follow the other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no difficulty about this. On leading Toby to the place where\n",

      "creasote-barrel came from,” I observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had thought of that. But you notice that he keeps on the pavement,\n",

      "scent now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It tended down towards the river-side, running through Belmont Place\n",
      "and Prince’s Street. At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to\n",
      "the water’s edge, where there was a small wooden wharf. Toby led us to\n",
      "the very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the dark\n",
      "current beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are out of luck,” said Holmes. “They have taken to a boat here.”\n",
      "Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the\n",
      "edge of the wharf. We took Toby round to each in turn, but, though he\n",
      "sniffed earnestly, he made no sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a wooden\n",

      "printed across it in large letters, and, underneath, “Boats to hire by\n",
      "the hour or day.” A second inscription above the door informed us that\n",
      "a steam launch was kept,—a statement which was confirmed by a great\n",

      "his face assumed an ominous expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This looks bad,” said he. “These fellows are sharper than I expected.\n",
      "They seem to have covered their tracks. There has, I fear, been\n",

      "\n",
      "He was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little,\n",

      "\n",

      "us hear of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear little chap!” said Holmes, strategically. “What a rosy-cheeked\n",
      "young rascal! Now, Jack, is there anything you would like?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth pondered for a moment. “I’d like a shillin’,” said he.\n",

      "“Nothing you would like better?”\n",

      "for me to manage, ’specially when my man is away days at a time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Away, is he?” said Holmes, in a disappointed voice. “I am sorry for\n",

      "\n",
      "“He’s been away since yesterday mornin’, sir, and, truth to tell, I am\n",
      "beginnin’ to feel frightened about him. But if it was about a boat,\n",
      "sir, maybe I could serve as well.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch that he has gone.\n",
      "That’s what puzzles me; for I know there ain’t more coals in her than\n",
      "would take her to about Woolwich and back. If he’d been away in the\n",
      "barge I’d ha’ thought nothin’; for many a time a job has taken him as\n",
      "far as Gravesend, and then if there was much doin’ there he might ha’\n",
      "stayed over. But what good is a steam launch without coals?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He might have bought some at a wharf down the river.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He might, sir, but it weren’t his way. Many a time I’ve heard him call\n",
      "out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags. Besides, I don’t like\n",
      "that wooden-legged man, wi’ his ugly face and outlandish talk. What did\n",
      "he want always knockin’ about here for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A wooden-legged man?” said Holmes, with bland surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that’s called more’n once for my\n",
      "old man. It was him that roused him up yesternight, and, what’s more,\n",
      "my man knew he was comin’, for he had steam up in the launch. I tell\n",
      "you straight, sir, I don’t feel easy in my mind about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, my dear Mrs. Smith,” said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders, “You\n",
      "are frightening yourself about nothing. How could you possibly tell\n",
      "that it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night? I don’t quite\n",
      "understand how you can be so sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“His voice, sir. I knew his voice, which is kind o’ thick and foggy. He\n",
      "tapped at the winder,—about three it would be. ‘Show a leg, matey,’\n",
      "says he: ‘time to turn out guard.’ My old man woke up Jim,—that’s my\n",
      "eldest,—and away they went, without so much as a word to me. I could\n",
      "hear the wooden leg clackin’ on the stones.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And was this wooden-legged man alone?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I am sorry, Mrs. Smith, for I wanted a steam launch, and I have heard\n",
      "good reports of the—Let me see, what is her name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The _Aurora_, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! She’s not that old green launch with a yellow line, very broad in\n",
      "the beam?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed. She’s as trim a little thing as any on the river. She’s\n",
      "been fresh painted, black with two red streaks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thanks. I hope that you will hear soon from Mr. Smith. I am going down\n",
      "the river; and if I should see anything of the _Aurora_ I shall let him\n",
      "know that you are uneasy. A black funnel, you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir. Black with a white band.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, of course. It was the sides which were black. Good-morning, Mrs.\n",
      "Smith.—There is a boatman here with a wherry, Watson. We shall take it\n",
      "and cross the river.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The main thing with people of that sort,” said Holmes, as we sat in\n",
      "the sheets of the wherry, “is never to let them think that their\n",
      "information can be of the slightest importance to you. If you do, they\n",
      "will instantly shut up like an oyster. If you listen to them under\n",
      "protest, as it were, you are very likely to get what you want.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“What would you do, then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the\n",
      "_Aurora_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear fellow, it would be a colossal task. She may have touched at\n",
      "any wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich.\n",
      "Below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places for\n",
      "miles. It would take you days and days to exhaust them, if you set\n",
      "about it alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Employ the police, then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment. He is\n",
      "not a bad fellow, and I should not like to do anything which would\n",
      "injure him professionally. But I have a fancy for working it out\n",
      "myself, now that we have gone so far.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Worse and worse! Our men would know that the chase was hot at their\n",
      "heels, and they would be off out of the country. As it is, they are\n",
      "likely enough to leave, but as long as they think they are perfectly\n",
      "safe they will be in no hurry. Jones’s energy will be of use to us\n",
      "there, for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily\n",
      "press, and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong\n",
      "scent.”\n",

      "\n",
      "We pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office, and Holmes\n",
      "despatched his wire. “Whom do you think that is to?” he asked, as we\n",

      "\n",
      "“I am sure I don’t know.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“This is just the case where they might be invaluable. If they fail, I\n",

      "will be with us before we have finished our breakfast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was between eight and nine o’clock now, and I was conscious of a\n",
      "strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night. I was\n",
      "limp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body. I had not the\n",
      "professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look\n",
      "at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem. As far as the\n",
      "death of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, and\n",
      "could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers. The treasure,\n",
      "however, was a different matter. That, or part of it, belonged\n",
      "rightfully to Miss Morstan. While there was a chance of recovering it I\n",
      "was ready to devote my life to the one object. True, if I found it it\n",
      "would probably put her forever beyond my reach. Yet it would be a petty\n",
      "and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that.\n",
      "If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold stronger\n",
      "reason to urge me on to find the treasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up\n",
      "wonderfully. When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid\n",
      "and Homes pouring out the coffee.\n",

      "“Here it is,” said he, laughing, and pointing to an open newspaper.\n",
      "“The energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up\n",
      "between them. But you have had enough of the case. Better have your ham\n",
      "and eggs first.”\n",

      "I took the paper from him and read the short notice, which was headed\n",
      "“Mysterious Business at Upper Norwood.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“About twelve o’clock last night,” said the _Standard_, “Mr.\n",
      "Bartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead\n",
      "in his room under circumstances which point to foul play. As far as we\n",
      "can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto’s\n",
      "person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased\n",
      "gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off. The\n",
      "discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had\n",
      "called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased.\n",
      "By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known\n",
      "member of the detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood\n",
      "Police Station, and was on the ground within half an hour of the first\n",
      "alarm. His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed\n",
      "towards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that\n",
      "the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with\n",
      "the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a\n",
      "porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo. It is quite certain that the\n",
      "thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones’s\n",
      "well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation\n",
      "have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not\n",
      "have entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way\n",
      "across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room\n",
      "which communicated with that in which the body was found. This fact,\n",
      "which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was\n",
      "no mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action of the\n",
      "officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such\n",
      "occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. We cannot but think\n",
      "that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our\n",
      "detectives more decentralised, and so brought into closer and more\n",
      "effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Isn’t it gorgeous!” said Holmes, grinning over his coffee-cup. “What\n",
      "do you think of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for\n",
      "the crime.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So do I. I wouldn’t answer for our safety now, if he should happen to\n",
      "have another of his attacks of energy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs.\n",
      "Hudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and\n",
      "dismay.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By heaven, Holmes,” I said, half rising, “I believe that they are\n",
      "really after us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, it’s not quite so bad as that. It is the unofficial force,—the\n",

      "As he spoke, there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the\n",
      "stairs, a clatter of high voices, and in rushed a dozen dirty and\n",
      "ragged little street-Arabs. There was some show of discipline among\n",
      "them, despite their tumultuous entry, for they instantly drew up in\n",
      "line and stood facing us with expectant faces. One of their number,\n",
      "taller and older than the others, stood forward with an air of lounging\n",
      "superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little\n",
      "scarecrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Got your message, sir,” said he, “and brought ’em on sharp. Three bob\n",
      "and a tanner for tickets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here you are,” said Holmes, producing some silver. “In future they can\n",
      "report to you, Wiggins, and you to me. I cannot have the house invaded\n",
      "in this way. However, it is just as well that you should all hear the\n",
      "instructions. I want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called\n",
      "the _Aurora_, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red streaks, funnel\n",
      "black with a white band. She is down the river somewhere. I want one\n",
      "boy to be at Mordecai Smith’s landing-stage opposite Millbank to say if\n",
      "the boat comes back. You must divide it out among yourselves, and do\n",
      "both banks thoroughly. Let me know the moment you have news. Is that\n",
      "all clear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, guv’nor,” said Wiggins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat.\n",
      "Here’s a day in advance. Now off you go!” He handed them a shilling\n",
      "each, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a moment\n",
      "later streaming down the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the launch is above water they will find her,” said Holmes, as he\n",
      "rose from the table and lit his pipe. “They can go everywhere, see\n",

      "all else had been overcome. I know the men, the launch, everything; and\n",
      "yet I can get no news. I have set other agencies at work, and used\n",
      "every means at my disposal. The whole river has been searched on either\n",
      "side, but there is no news, nor has Mrs. Smith heard of her husband. I\n",

      "somewhat morose. He would hardly reply to my questions, and busied\n",

      "much heating of retorts and distilling of vapours, ending at last in a\n",

      "“we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more\n",
      "complex and mysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence has\n",

      "been in any way concerned in the matter. He and the housekeeper, Mrs.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was clearly Holmes’s doing. The Baker Street address was enough to\n",

      "by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural\n",

      "\n",
      "It was a long day. Every time that a knock came to the door, or a sharp\n",

      "returning or an answer to his advertisement. I tried to read, but my\n",
      "thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted\n",
      "and villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could there be, I wondered,\n",
      "some radical flaw in my companion’s reasoning. Might he be suffering\n",
      "from some huge self-deception? Was it not possible that his nimble and\n",
      "speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises? I\n",
      "had never known him to be wrong; and yet the keenest reasoner may\n",
      "occasionally be deceived. He was likely, I thought, to fall into error\n",
      "through the over-refinement of his logic,—his preference for a subtle\n",
      "and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay\n",
      "ready to his hand. Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the\n",
      "evidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions. When I looked\n",
      "back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them trivial\n",
      "in themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could not\n",
      "disguise from myself that even if Holmes’s explanation were incorrect\n",

      "At three o’clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an\n",

      "than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he,\n",
      "however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who\n",
      "had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His expression\n",

      "round Mr. Sholto, sir, when pop he went through a hole in the middle of\n",
      "it. He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken. From the\n",
      "time that he left his brother’s room he was never out of sight of some\n",
      "one or other. So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through\n",

      "the whole, I think he would have made a most promising officer, and I\n",
      "don’t care who knows it. I have had a wire from him this morning, by\n",
      "which I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business.\n",
      "Here is the message.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the telegram out of his pocket, and handed it to me. It was\n",

      "His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing was\n",
      "painfully asthmatic. As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his\n",
      "shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs. He had a\n",
      "coloured scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face save\n",
      "a pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long grey\n",
      "side-whiskers. Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable\n",
      "master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it, my man?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; but I am acting for him. You can tell me any message you have for\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was to him himself I was to tell it,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I tell you that I am acting for him. Was it about Mordecai Smith’s\n",
      "boat?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. I knows well where it is. An’ I knows where the men he is after\n",
      "are. An’ I knows where the treasure is. I knows all about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then tell me, and I shall let him know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was to him I was to tell it,” he repeated, with the petulant\n",
      "obstinacy of a very old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you must wait for him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no; I ain’t goin’ to lose a whole day to please no one. If Mr.\n",
      "Holmes ain’t here, then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself. I\n",
      "don’t care about the look of either of you, and I won’t tell a word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He shuffled towards the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wait a bit, my friend,” said he. “You have important information, and\n",
      "you must not walk off. We shall keep you, whether you like or not,\n",
      "until our friend returns.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man made a little run towards the door, but, as Athelney Jones\n",
      "put his broad back up against it, he recognised the uselessness of\n",
      "resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pretty sort o’ treatment this!” he cried, stamping his stick. “I come\n",
      "here to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in my life, seize\n",
      "me and treat me in this fashion!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will be none the worse,” I said. “We shall recompense you for the\n",
      "loss of your time. Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not have\n",
      "long to wait.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his face\n",
      "resting on his hands. Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk.\n",
      "Suddenly, however, Holmes’s voice broke in upon us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think that you might offer me a cigar too,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "We both started in our chairs. There was Holmes sitting close to us\n",
      "with an air of quiet amusement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Holmes!” I exclaimed. “You here! But where is the old man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here is the old man,” said he, holding out a heap of white hair. “Here\n",
      "he is,—wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all. I thought my disguise was\n",
      "pretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, You rogue!” cried Jones, highly delighted. “You would have made an\n",
      "actor, and a rare one. You had the proper workhouse cough, and those\n",
      "weak legs of yours are worth ten pounds a week. I thought I knew the\n",
      "glint of your eye, though. You didn’t get away from us so easily, You\n",
      "see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been working in that get-up all day,” said he, lighting his\n",
      "cigar. “You see, a good many of the criminal classes begin to know\n",
      "me,—especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my\n",
      "cases: so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise like\n",
      "this. You got my wire?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; that was what brought me here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How has your case prospered?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It has all come to nothing. I have had to release two of my prisoners,\n",
      "and there is no evidence against the other two.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind. We shall give you two others in the place of them. But you\n",
      "must put yourself under my orders. You are welcome to all the official\n",
      "credit, but you must act on the line that I point out. Is that agreed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Entirely, if you will help me to the men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, in the first place I shall want a fast police-boat—a steam\n",
      "launch—to be at the Westminster Stairs at seven o’clock.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is easily managed. There is always one about there; but I can\n",
      "step across the road and telephone to make sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I shall want two stanch men, in case of resistance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There will be two or three in the boat. What else?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When we secure the men we shall get the treasure. I think that it\n",
      "would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the\n",
      "young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs. Let her be the first\n",
      "to open it.—Eh, Watson?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be a great pleasure to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rather an irregular proceeding,” said Jones, shaking his head.\n",
      "“However, the whole thing is irregular, and I suppose we must wink at\n",
      "it. The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities\n",
      "until after the official investigation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly. That is easily managed. One other point. I should much like\n",
      "to have a few details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan Small\n",
      "himself. You know I like to work the detail of my cases out. There is\n",
      "no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him, either here\n",
      "in my rooms or elsewhere, as long as he is efficiently guarded?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you are master of the situation. I have had no proof yet of the\n",
      "existence of this Jonathan Small. However, if you can catch him I don’t\n",
      "see how I can refuse you an interview with him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is understood, then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perfectly. Is there anything else?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only that I insist upon your dining with us. It will be ready in half\n",
      "an hour. I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something a little\n",
      "choice in white wines.—Watson, you have never yet recognised my merits\n",
      "as a housekeeper.”\n",

      "Our meal was a merry one. Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he\n",
      "chose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of\n",
      "nervous exaltation. I have never known him so brilliant. He spoke on a\n",
      "quick succession of subjects,—on miracle-plays, on mediæval pottery, on\n",
      "Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the war-ships\n",
      "of the future,—handling each as though he had made a special study of\n",
      "it. His bright humour marked the reaction from his black depression of\n",
      "the preceding days. Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his\n",
      "hours of relaxation, and faced his dinner with the air of a _bon\n",
      "vivant_. For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing\n",
      "the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes’s gaiety. None of\n",
      "us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at his watch, and filled up\n",
      "three glasses with port. “One bumper,” said he, “to the success of our\n",
      "little expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have you a\n",
      "pistol, Watson?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have my old service-revolver in my desk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You had best take it, then. It is well to be prepared. I see that the\n",
      "cab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, and\n",
      "found our launch awaiting us. Holmes eyed it critically.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,—that green lamp at the side.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then take it off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast\n",
      "off. Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern. There was one man at the\n",
      "rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors\n",
      "forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where to?” asked Jones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To the Tower. Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson’s Yard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Our craft was evidently a very fast one. We shot past the long lines of\n",
      "loaded barges as though they were stationary. Holmes smiled with\n",
      "satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We ought to be able to catch anything on the river,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, hardly that. But there are not many launches to beat us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We shall have to catch the _Aurora_, and she has a name for being a\n",
      "clipper. I will tell you how the land lies, Watson. You recollect how\n",
      "annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical\n",
      "analysis. One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work\n",
      "is the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in dissolving the\n",
      "hydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the\n",
      "Sholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. My boys had been up\n",
      "the river and down the river without result. The launch was not at any\n",
      "landing-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly have\n",
      "been scuttled to hide their traces,—though that always remained as a\n",
      "possible hypothesis if all else failed. I knew this man Small had a\n",
      "certain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of\n",
      "anything in the nature of delicate finesse. That is usually a product\n",
      "of higher education. I then reflected that since he had certainly been\n",
      "in London some time—as we had evidence that he maintained a continual\n",
      "watch over Pondicherry Lodge—he could hardly leave at a moment’s\n",
      "notice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to\n",
      "arrange his affairs. That was the balance of probability, at any rate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It seems to me to be a little weak,” said I. “It is more probable that\n",
      "he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his\n",
      "expedition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I hardly think so. This lair of his would be too valuable a\n",
      "retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he\n",
      "could do without it. But a second consideration struck me. Jonathan\n",
      "Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion,\n",
      "however much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and\n",
      "possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy. He was quite sharp\n",
      "enough to see that. They had started from their head-quarters under\n",
      "cover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad\n",
      "light. Now, it was past three o’clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when\n",
      "they got the boat. It would be quite bright, and people would be about\n",
      "in an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. They\n",
      "paid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final\n",
      "escape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a\n",
      "couple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took,\n",
      "and whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under\n",
      "cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no\n",
      "doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the\n",
      "Colonies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the launch? They could not have taken that to their lodgings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite\n",
      "of its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of Small, and\n",
      "looked at it as a man of his capacity would. He would probably consider\n",
      "that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make\n",
      "pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track. How, then,\n",
      "could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted? I\n",
      "wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes. I could only\n",
      "think of one way of doing it. I might land the launch over to some\n",
      "boat-builder or repairer, with directions to make a trifling change in\n",
      "her. She would then be removed to his shed or yard, and so be\n",
      "effectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a few\n",
      "hours’ notice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That seems simple enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be\n",
      "overlooked. However, I determined to act on the idea. I started at once\n",
      "in this harmless seaman’s rig and inquired at all the yards down the\n",
      "river. I drew blank at fifteen, but at the sixteenth—Jacobson’s—I\n",
      "learned that the _Aurora_ had been handed over to them two days ago by\n",
      "a wooden-legged man, with some trivial directions as to her rudder.\n",
      "‘There ain’t naught amiss with her rudder,’ said the foreman. ‘There\n",
      "she lies, with the red streaks.’ At that moment who should come down\n",
      "but Mordecai Smith, the missing owner? He was rather the worse for\n",
      "liquor. I should not, of course, have known him, but he bellowed out\n",
      "his name and the name of his launch. ‘I want her to-night at eight\n",
      "o’clock,’ said he,—‘eight o’clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen\n",
      "who won’t be kept waiting.’ They had evidently paid him well, for he\n",
      "was very flush of money, chucking shillings about to the men. I\n",
      "followed him some distance, but he subsided into an ale-house: so I\n",
      "went back to the yard, and, happening to pick up one of my boys on the\n",
      "way, I stationed him as a sentry over the launch. He is to stand at\n",
      "water’s edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start. We shall\n",
      "be lying off in the stream, and it will be a strange thing if we do not\n",
      "take men, treasure, and all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men or\n",
      "not,” said Jones; “but if the affair were in my hands I should have had\n",
      "a body of police in Jacobson’s Yard, and arrested them when they came\n",
      "down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which would have been never. This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow.\n",
      "He would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made him suspicious lie\n",
      "snug for another week.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to their\n",
      "hiding-place,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In that case I should have wasted my day. I think that it is a hundred\n",
      "to one against Smith knowing where they live. As long as he has liquor\n",
      "and good pay, why should he ask questions? They send him messages what\n",
      "to do. No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the\n",
      "long series of bridges which span the Thames. As we passed the City the\n",
      "last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St.\n",
      "Paul’s. It was twilight before we reached the Tower.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is Jacobson’s Yard,” said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of masts\n",
      "and rigging on the Surrey side. “Cruise gently up and down here under\n",
      "cover of this string of lighters.” He took a pair of night-glasses from\n",
      "his pocket and gazed some time at the shore. “I see my sentry at his\n",
      "post,” he remarked, “but no sign of a handkerchief.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them,” said\n",
      "Jones, eagerly. We were all eager by this time, even the policemen and\n",
      "stokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have no right to take anything for granted,” Holmes answered. “It\n",
      "is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot be\n",
      "certain. From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and they\n",
      "can hardly see us. It will be a clear night and plenty of light. We\n",
      "must stay where we are. See how the folk swarm over yonder in the\n",
      "gaslight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are coming from work in the yard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dirty-looking rascals, but I suppose every one has some little\n",
      "immortal spark concealed about him. You would not think it, to look at\n",
      "them. There is no _a priori_ probability about it. A strange enigma is\n",
      "man!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal,” I suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Winwood Reade is good upon the subject,” said Holmes. “He remarks\n",
      "that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate\n",
      "he becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never\n",
      "foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what\n",
      "an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages\n",
      "remain constant. So says the statistician. But do I see a handkerchief?\n",
      "Surely there is a white flutter over yonder.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, it is your boy,” I cried. “I can see him plainly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And there is the _Aurora_,” exclaimed Holmes, “and going like the\n",
      "devil! Full speed ahead, engineer. Make after that launch with the\n",
      "yellow light. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to\n",
      "have the heels of us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two\n",
      "or three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before we\n",
      "saw her. Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore,\n",
      "going at a tremendous rate. Jones looked gravely at her and shook his\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is very fast,” he said. “I doubt if we shall catch her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We _must_ catch her!” cried Holmes, between his teeth. “Heap it on,\n",
      "stokers! Make her do all she can! If we burn the boat we must have\n",
      "them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "We were fairly after her now. The furnaces roared, and the powerful\n",
      "engines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart. Her sharp,\n",
      "steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to\n",
      "right and to left of us. With every throb of the engines we sprang and\n",
      "quivered like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in our bows\n",
      "threw a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us. Right ahead a\n",
      "dark blur upon the water showed where the _Aurora_ lay, and the swirl\n",
      "of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going. We\n",
      "flashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and out, behind\n",
      "this one and round the other. Voices hailed us out of the darkness, but\n",
      "still the _Aurora_ thundered on, and still we followed close upon her\n",
      "track.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pile it on, men, pile it on!” cried Holmes, looking down into the\n",
      "engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager,\n",
      "aquiline face. “Get every pound of steam you can.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think we gain a little,” said Jones, with his eyes on the _Aurora_.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sure of it,” said I. “We shall be up with her in a very few\n",
      "minutes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with\n",
      "three barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by putting our\n",
      "helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could round\n",
      "them and recover our way the _Aurora_ had gained a good two hundred\n",
      "yards. She was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertain\n",
      "twilight was setting into a clear starlit night. Our boilers were\n",
      "strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with\n",
      "the fierce energy which was driving us along. We had shot through the\n",
      "Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up\n",
      "again after rounding the Isle of Dogs. The dull blur in front of us\n",
      "resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty _Aurora_. Jones\n",
      "turned our search-light upon her, so that we could plainly see the\n",
      "figures upon her deck. One man sat by the stern, with something black\n",
      "between his knees over which he stooped. Beside him lay a dark mass\n",
      "which looked like a Newfoundland dog. The boy held the tiller, while\n",
      "against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to\n",
      "the waist, and shovelling coals for dear life. They may have had some\n",
      "doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as\n",
      "we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no\n",
      "longer be any question about it. At Greenwich we were about three\n",
      "hundred paces behind them. At Blackwall we could not have been more\n",
      "than two hundred and fifty. I have coursed many creatures in many\n",
      "countries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me such\n",
      "a wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily we\n",
      "drew in upon them, yard by yard. In the silence of the night we could\n",
      "hear the panting and clanking of their machinery. The man in the stern\n",
      "still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though he\n",
      "were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure with a\n",
      "glance the distance which still separated us. Nearer we came and\n",
      "nearer. Jones yelled to them to stop. We were not more than four boat’s\n",
      "lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. It was a\n",
      "clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the\n",
      "melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man in the\n",
      "stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us,\n",
      "cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized,\n",
      "powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could\n",
      "see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the\n",
      "right side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries there was\n",
      "movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straightened itself\n",
      "into a little black man—the smallest I have ever seen—with a great,\n",
      "misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair. Holmes had\n",
      "already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this\n",
      "savage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster\n",
      "or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough\n",
      "to give a man a sleepless night. Never have I seen features so deeply\n",
      "marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small eyes glowed and\n",
      "burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from\n",
      "his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fire if he raises his hand,” said Holmes, quietly. We were within a\n",
      "boat’s-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. I\n",
      "can see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his legs\n",
      "far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with his\n",
      "hideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light\n",
      "of our lantern.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was well that we had so clear a view of him. Even as we looked he\n",
      "plucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood, like\n",
      "a school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang out\n",
      "together. He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of\n",
      "choking cough fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of\n",
      "his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. At the\n",
      "same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put\n",
      "it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank,\n",
      "while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet. We were\n",
      "round after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank.\n",
      "It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide\n",
      "expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of\n",
      "decaying vegetation. The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the\n",
      "mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water.\n",
      "The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length\n",
      "into the sodden soil. In vain he struggled and writhed. Not one step\n",
      "could he possibly take either forwards or backwards. He yelled in\n",
      "impotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot,\n",
      "but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky\n",
      "bank. When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored\n",
      "that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that\n",
      "we were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish,\n",
      "over our side. The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their\n",
      "launch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded. The _Aurora_\n",
      "herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern. A solid iron chest of\n",
      "Indian workmanship stood upon the deck. This, there could be no\n",
      "question, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of\n",
      "the Sholtos. There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so we\n",
      "transferred it carefully to our own little cabin. As we steamed slowly\n",
      "up-stream again, we flashed our search-light in every direction, but\n",
      "there was no sign of the Islander. Somewhere in the dark ooze at the\n",
      "bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our\n",
      "shores.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See here,” said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. “We were\n",
      "hardly quick enough with our pistols.” There, sure enough, just behind\n",
      "where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we\n",
      "knew so well. It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we\n",
      "fired. Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy\n",
      "fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible\n",
      "death which had passed so close to us that night.\n",

      "Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done\n",
      "so much and waited so long to gain. He was a sunburned, reckless-eyed\n",
      "fellow, with a network of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany\n",
      "features, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was a singular\n",
      "prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be\n",
      "easily turned from his purpose. His age may have been fifty or\n",
      "thereabouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with grey. His\n",
      "face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows and\n",
      "aggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression\n",
      "when moved to anger. He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap,\n",
      "and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen,\n",
      "twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings.\n",
      "It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and\n",

      "“Well, Jonathan Small,” said Holmes, lighting a cigar, “I am sorry that\n",
      "it has come to this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so am I, sir,” he answered, frankly. “I don’t believe that I can\n",
      "swing over the job. I give you my word on the book that I never raised\n",
      "hand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound Tonga who shot\n",
      "one of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir. I was as\n",
      "grieved as if it had been my blood-relation. I welted the little devil\n",
      "with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not\n",
      "undo it again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have a cigar,” said Holmes; “and you had best take a pull out of my\n",
      "flask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak a\n",
      "man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while you\n",
      "were climbing the rope?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The truth\n",
      "is that I hoped to find the room clear. I knew the habits of the house\n",
      "pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to\n",
      "his supper. I shall make no secret of the business. The best defence\n",
      "that I can make is just the simple truth. Now, if it had been the old\n",
      "major I would have swung for him with a light heart. I would have\n",
      "thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar. But it’s\n",
      "cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto, with whom I\n",
      "had no quarrel whatever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard. He\n",
      "is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true\n",
      "account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you\n",
      "do I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that the\n",
      "poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached\n",

      "\n",
      "“That he was, sir. I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him\n",
      "grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the\n",
      "window. It fairly shook me, sir. I’d have half killed Tonga for it if\n",
      "he had not scrambled off. That was how he came to leave his club, and\n",
      "some of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say helped to put\n",
      "you on our track; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell. I\n",
      "don’t feel no malice against you for it. But it does seem a queer\n",
      "thing,” he added, with a bitter smile, “that I who have a fair claim to\n",
      "nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my\n",
      "life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to spend the\n",
      "other half digging drains at Dartmoor. It was an evil day for me when\n",
      "first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with the\n",
      "Agra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the\n",
      "man who owned it. To him it brought murder, to Major Sholto it brought\n",
      "fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders\n",
      "into the tiny cabin. “Quite a family party,” he remarked. “I think I\n",
      "shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think we may all\n",
      "congratulate each other. Pity we didn’t take the other alive; but there\n",
      "was no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it rather\n",
      "fine. It was all we could do to overhaul her.”\n",

      "“Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that\n",

      "\n",
      "“Neither he did,” cried our prisoner,—“not a word. I chose his launch\n",
      "because I heard that she was a flier. We told him nothing, but we paid\n",

      "If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick in\n",
      "condemning them.” It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones\n",
      "was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the\n",

      "am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this. It is\n",
      "most irregular; but of course an agreement is an agreement. I must,\n",
      "however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you\n",
      "have so valuable a charge. You will drive, no doubt?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I shall drive.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“Hum! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We have\n",

      "us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester’s. The servant seemed surprised at so late a\n",
      "visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she explained,\n",
      "and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in the\n",

      "She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white\n",
      "diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and\n",

      "in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and tinting\n",
      "with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair. One\n",
      "white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and her whole\n",
      "pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the sound of my\n",
      "foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright flush of\n",
      "surprise and of pleasure coloured her pale cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I heard a cab drive up,” she said. “I thought that Mrs. Forrester had\n",
      "come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you. What\n",
      "news have you brought me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have brought something better than news,” said I, putting down the\n",
      "box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my\n",
      "heart was heavy within me. “I have brought you something which is worth\n",
      "all the news in the world. I have brought you a fortune.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She glanced at the iron box. “Is that the treasure, then?” she asked,\n",
      "coolly enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and half is\n",
      "Thaddeus Sholto’s. You will have a couple of hundred thousand each.\n",
      "Think of that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There will be few\n",
      "richer young ladies in England. Is it not glorious?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that\n",
      "she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her\n",
      "eyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I have it,” said she, “I owe it to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,” I answered, “not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue\n",
      "which has taxed even his analytical genius. As it was, we very nearly\n",
      "lost it at the last moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson,” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her\n",
      "last,—Holmes’s new method of search, the discovery of the _Aurora_, the\n",
      "appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and the\n",
      "wild chase down the Thames. She listened with parted lips and shining\n",
      "eyes to my recital of our adventures. When I spoke of the dart which\n",
      "had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I feared that she\n",
      "was about to faint.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is nothing,” she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water. “I\n",

      "friends in such horrible peril.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is all over,” I answered. “It was nothing. I will tell you no\n",
      "more gloomy details. Let us turn to something brighter. There is the\n",
      "treasure. What could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring it\n",
      "with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be of the greatest interest to me,” she said. There was no\n",
      "eagerness in her voice, however. It had struck her, doubtless, that it\n",
      "might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which\n",
      "had cost so much to win.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a pretty box!” she said, stooping over it. “This is Indian work,\n",
      "I suppose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; it is Benares metal-work.”\n",
      "\n",

      "be of some value. Where is the key?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Small threw it into the Thames,” I answered. “I must borrow Mrs.\n",
      "Forrester’s poker.” There was in the front a thick and broad hasp,\n",
      "wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust the end\n",
      "of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open\n",
      "with a loud snap. With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We both\n",
      "stood gazing in astonishment. The box was empty!\n",
      "\n",
      "No wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch\n",
      "thick all round. It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest\n",
      "constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or crumb\n",
      "of metal or jewelry lay within it. It was absolutely and completely\n",
      "empty.\n",

      "\n",
      "As I listened to the words and realised what they meant, a great shadow\n",
      "seemed to pass from my soul. I did not know how this Agra treasure had\n",
      "weighed me down, until now that it was finally removed. It was selfish,\n",
      "no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realise nothing save that the\n",
      "golden barrier was gone from between us. “Thank God!” I ejaculated from\n",
      "my very heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile. “Why do you say\n",
      "that?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because you are within my reach again,” I said, taking her hand. She\n",
      "did not withdraw it. “Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man\n",
      "loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips. Now\n",
      "that they are gone I can tell you how I love you. That is why I said,\n",
      "‘Thank God.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I say, ‘Thank God,’ too,” she whispered, as I drew her to my\n",

      "enjoy it! I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of Tonga’s\n",
      "darts in my hide, than live in a convict’s cell and feel that another\n",
      "man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine.”\n",
      "Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this came out in a wild\n",
      "whirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the handcuffs clanked\n",
      "together with the impassioned movement of his hands. I could\n",
      "understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it was\n",

      "I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would\n",
      "be so very glad to see me. They were all steady, chapel-going folk,\n",
      "small farmers, well-known and respected over the country-side, while I\n",

      "White, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an overseer\n",
      "to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work. He happened\n",
      "to be a friend of our colonel’s, who had taken an interest in me since\n",
      "the accident. To make a long story short, the colonel recommended me\n",
      "strongly for the post and, as the work was mostly to be done on\n",
      "horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough knee left to\n",
      "keep good grip on the saddle. What I had to do was to ride over the\n",
      "plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to report the\n",
      "idlers. The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and altogether I\n",
      "was content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo-planting. Mr.\n",
      "Abel White was a kind man, and he would often drop into my little\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, I was never in luck’s way long. Suddenly, without a note of\n",
      "warning, the great mutiny broke upon us. One month India lay as still\n",
      "and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were\n",
      "two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a\n",
      "perfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,—a deal more\n",
      "than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only know what\n",
      "I saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was at a place called Muttra,\n",
      "near the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night after night the whole\n",
      "sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had\n",
      "small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their\n",
      "wives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest\n",
      "troops. Mr. Abel White was an obstinate man. He had it in his head that\n",
      "the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as\n",
      "suddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on his veranda, drinking\n",
      "whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze\n",
      "about him. Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife,\n",
      "used to do the book-work and the managing. Well, one fine day the crash\n",
      "came. I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowly\n",
      "home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled\n",
      "together at the bottom of a steep nullah. I rode down to see what it\n",
      "was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson’s\n",
      "wife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs.\n",
      "A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face,\n",
      "quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying\n",
      "across each other in front of him. I reined up my horse, wondering\n",
      "which way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling\n",
      "up from Abel White’s bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through\n",
      "the roof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would\n",
      "only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter. From where I\n",
      "stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats\n",
      "still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house. Some\n",
      "of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so I\n",
      "broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe\n",
      "within the walls at Agra.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either. The\n",
      "whole country was up like a swarm of bees. Wherever the English could\n",
      "collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns\n",
      "commanded. Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives. It was a fight\n",
      "of the millions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part of it was\n",
      "that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners, were\n",
      "our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling our own\n",
      "weapons, and blowing our own bugle-calls. At Agra there were the 3rd\n",
      "Bengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery of\n",
      "artillery. A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed,\n",
      "and this I joined, wooden leg and all. We went out to meet the rebels\n",
      "at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time, but our\n",
      "powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing but the worst news came to us from every side,—which is not to\n",
      "be wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were\n",
      "right in the heart of it. Lucknow is rather better than a hundred miles\n",
      "to the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south. From every point\n",
      "on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and outrage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fierce\n",
      "devil-worshippers of all sorts. Our handful of men were lost among the\n",
      "narrow, winding streets. Our leader moved across the river, therefore,\n",
      "and took up his position in the old fort at Agra. I don’t know if any\n",
      "of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort. It\n",
      "is a very queer place,—the queerest that ever I was in, and I have been\n",
      "in some rum corners, too. First of all, it is enormous in size. I\n",
      "should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres. There is a\n",
      "modern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, and\n",
      "everything else, with plenty of room over. But the modern part is\n",
      "nothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which\n",
      "is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes. It is all full of\n",
      "great deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting\n",
      "in and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it. For\n",
      "this reason it was seldom that any one went into it, though now and\n",
      "again a party with torches might go exploring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it,\n",
      "but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be\n",
      "guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was\n",
      "actually held by our troops. We were short-handed, with hardly men\n",
      "enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns. It was\n",
      "impossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of\n",
      "the innumerable gates. What we did was to organise a central\n",
      "guard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the\n",
      "charge of one white man and two or three natives. I was selected to\n",
      "take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door\n",
      "upon the southwest side of the building. Two Sikh troopers were placed\n",
      "under my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire\n",
      "my musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central\n",
      "guard. As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as\n",
      "the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and\n",
      "corridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time\n",
      "to be of any use in case of an actual attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since\n",
      "I was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that. For two nights I\n",
      "kept the watch with my Punjaubees. They were tall, fierce-looking\n",
      "chaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting-men\n",
      "who had borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah. They could talk\n",
      "English pretty well, but I could get little out of them. They preferred\n",
      "to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo. For\n",
      "myself, I used to stand outside the gateway, looking down on the broad,\n",
      "winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city. The\n",
      "beating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and howls of the\n",
      "rebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were enough to remind us all\n",
      "night of our dangerous neighbours across the stream. Every two hours\n",
      "the officer of the night used to come round to all the posts, to make\n",
      "sure that all was well.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, driving\n",
      "rain. It was dreary work standing in the gateway hour after hour in\n",
      "such weather. I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, but\n",
      "without much success. At two in the morning the rounds passed, and\n",
      "broke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that my\n",
      "companions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and\n",
      "laid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhs\n",
      "were upon me. One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my\n",
      "head, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between\n",
      "his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My first thought was that these fellows were in league with the\n",
      "rebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault. If our door were\n",
      "in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women and\n",
      "children be treated as they were in Cawnpore. Maybe you gentlemen think\n",
      "that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my word\n",
      "that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife at my\n",
      "throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream, if it\n",
      "was my last one, which might alarm the main guard. The man who held me\n",
      "seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it, he\n",
      "whispered, ‘Don’t make a noise. The fort is safe enough. There are no\n",
      "rebel dogs on this side of the river.’ There was the ring of truth in\n",
      "what he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man. I\n",
      "could read it in the fellow’s brown eyes. I waited, therefore, in\n",
      "silence, to see what it was that they wanted from me.\n",

      "will be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs. No\n",
      "one can know about the matter, for here we are cut off from all men.\n",
      "What could be better for the purpose? Say again, then, Sahib, whether\n",
      "you are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘I am with you heart and soul,’ said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘It is well,’ he answered, handing me back my firelock. ‘You see that\n",
      "we trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken. We have\n",
      "now only to wait for my brother and the merchant.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?’ I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘The plan is his. He has devised it. We will go to the gate and share\n",
      "the watch with Mahomet Singh.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“The rain was still falling steadily, for it was just the beginning of\n",
      "the wet season. Brown, heavy clouds were drifting across the sky, and\n",
      "it was hard to see more than a stone-cast. A deep moat lay in front of\n",
      "our door, but the water was in places nearly dried up, and it could\n",
      "easily be crossed. It was strange to me to be standing there with those\n",
      "two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side\n",
      "of the moat. It vanished among the mound-heaps, and then appeared again\n",
      "coming slowly in our direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Here they are!’ I exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘You will challenge him, Sahib, as usual,’ whispered Abdullah. ‘Give\n",
      "him no cause for fear. Send us in with him, and we shall do the rest\n",
      "while you stay here on guard. Have the lantern ready to uncover, that\n",
      "we may be sure that it is indeed the man.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“The light had flickered onwards, now stopping and now advancing, until\n",
      "I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat. I let\n",
      "them scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, and climb\n",
      "half-way up to the gate, before I challenged them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Who goes there?’ said I, in a subdued voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Friends,’ came the answer. I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood\n",
      "of light upon them. The first was an enormous Sikh, with a black beard\n",
      "which swept nearly down to his cummerbund. Outside of a show I have\n",
      "never seen so tall a man. The other was a little, fat, round fellow,\n",
      "with a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done up in a\n",
      "shawl. He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his hands\n",
      "twitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left and\n",
      "right with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when he\n",
      "ventures out from his hole. It gave me the chills to think of killing\n",
      "him, but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint\n",
      "within me. When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy\n",
      "and came running up towards me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Your protection, Sahib,’ he panted,—‘your protection for the unhappy\n",
      "merchant Achmet. I have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seek\n",
      "the shelter of the fort at Agra. I have been robbed and beaten and\n",
      "abused because I have been the friend of the Company. It is a blessed\n",
      "night this when I am once more in safety,—I and my poor possessions.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘What have you in the bundle?’ I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘An iron box,’ he answered, ‘which contains one or two little family\n",
      "matters which are of no value to others, but which I should be sorry to\n",
      "lose. Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall reward you, young Sahib, and\n",
      "your governor also, if he will give me the shelter I ask.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man. The more I\n",
      "looked at his fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that we\n",
      "should slay him in cold blood. It was best to get it over.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Take him to the main guard,’ said I. The two Sikhs closed in upon him\n",
      "on each side, and the giant walked behind, while they marched in\n",
      "through the dark gateway. Never was a man so compassed round with\n",
      "death. I remained at the gateway with the lantern.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through\n",
      "the lonely corridors. Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and a\n",
      "scuffle, with the sound of blows. A moment later there came, to my\n",
      "horror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with the loud\n",
      "breathing of a running man. I turned my lantern down the long, straight\n",
      "passage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind, with a smear\n",
      "of blood across his face, and close at his heels, bounding like a\n",
      "tiger, the great black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in his hand.\n",
      "I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant. He was\n",
      "gaining on the Sikh, and I could see that if he once passed me and got\n",
      "to the open air he would save himself yet. My heart softened to him,\n",
      "but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter. I cast\n",
      "my firelock between his legs as he raced past, and he rolled twice over\n",
      "like a shot rabbit. Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon\n",
      "him, and buried his knife twice in his side. The man never uttered moan\n",
      "nor moved muscle, but lay were he had fallen. I think myself that he\n",
      "may have broken his neck with the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I am\n",
      "keeping my promise. I am telling you every work of the business just\n",
      "exactly as it happened, whether it is in my favour or not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped, and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-water\n",
      "which Holmes had brewed for him. For myself, I confess that I had now\n",
      "conceived the utmost horror of the man, not only for this cold-blooded\n",
      "business in which he had been concerned, but even more for the somewhat\n",
      "flippant and careless way in which he narrated it. Whatever punishment\n",
      "was in store for him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeply\n",
      "interested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon their\n",
      "faces. He may have observed it, for there was a touch of defiance in\n",
      "his voice and manner as he proceeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was all very bad, no doubt,” said he. “I should like to know how\n",
      "many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when\n",
      "they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains.\n",
      "Besides, it was my life or his when once he was in the fort. If he had\n",
      "got out, the whole business would come to light, and I should have been\n",
      "court-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people were not very\n",
      "lenient at a time like that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on with your story,” said Holmes, shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar, and I. A fine weight he was,\n",
      "too, for all that he was so short. Mahomet Singh was left to guard the\n",
      "door. We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared. It\n",
      "was some distance off, where a winding passage leads to a great empty\n",
      "hall, the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces. The earth\n",
      "floor had sunk in at one place, making a natural grave, so we left\n",
      "Achmet the merchant there, having first covered him over with loose\n",
      "bricks. This done, we all went back to the treasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked. The box was\n",
      "the same which now lies open upon your table. A key was hung by a\n",
      "silken cord to that carved handle upon the top. We opened it, and the\n",
      "light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have\n",
      "read of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore. It was\n",
      "blinding to look upon them. When we had feasted our eyes we took them\n",
      "all out and made a list of them. There were one hundred and forty-three\n",
      "diamonds of the first water, including one which has been called, I\n",
      "believe, ‘the Great Mogul’ and is said to be the second largest stone\n",
      "in existence. Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and one\n",
      "hundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small. There\n",
      "were forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates,\n",
      "and a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cats’-eyes, turquoises, and\n",
      "other stones, the very names of which I did not know at the time,\n",
      "though I have become more familiar with them since. Besides this, there\n",
      "were nearly three hundred very fine pearls, twelve of which were set in\n",
      "a gold coronet. By the way, these last had been taken out of the chest\n",
      "and were not there when I recovered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and\n",
      "carried them to the gateway to show them to Mahomet Singh. Then we\n",
      "solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our\n",
      "secret. We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country\n",
      "should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among\n",
      "ourselves. There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems of such\n",
      "value were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there was no\n",
      "privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them. We carried\n",
      "the box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the body,\n",
      "and there, under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall, we made a\n",
      "hollow and put our treasure. We made careful note of the place, and\n",
      "next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of the\n",
      "four of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each always\n",
      "act for all, so that none might take advantage. That is an oath that I\n",
      "can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, there’s no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian\n",
      "mutiny. After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the back\n",
      "of the business was broken. Fresh troops came pouring in, and Nana\n",
      "Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier. A flying column under\n",
      "Colonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared the Pandies away from\n",
      "it. Peace seemed to be settling upon the country, and we four were\n",
      "beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off\n",
      "with our shares of the plunder. In a moment, however, our hopes were\n",
      "shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It came about in this way. When the rajah put his jewels into the\n",
      "hands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man.\n",
      "They are suspicious folk in the East, however: so what does this rajah\n",
      "do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the\n",
      "spy upon the first? This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out\n",
      "of his sight, and he followed him like his shadow. He went after him\n",
      "that night and saw him pass through the doorway. Of course he thought\n",
      "he had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission there\n",
      "himself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet. This seemed to him\n",
      "so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who brought\n",
      "it to the ears of the commandant. A thorough search was quickly made,\n",
      "and the body was discovered. Thus at the very moment that we thought\n",
      "that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a\n",
      "charge of murder,—three of us because we had held the gate that night,\n",
      "and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the\n",
      "murdered man. Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial, for\n",
      "the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India: so no one had any\n",
      "particular interest in them. The murder, however, was clearly made out,\n",
      "and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it. The\n",
      "three Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I was condemned to death,\n",
      "though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then. There\n",
      "we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of\n",
      "ever getting out again, while we each held a secret which might have\n",
      "put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it. It was\n",
      "enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and\n",
      "the cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have rice to eat and water\n",
      "to drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside, just\n",
      "waiting to be picked up. It might have driven me mad; but I was always\n",
      "a pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bided my time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At last it seemed to me to have come. I was changed from Agra to\n",
      "Madras, and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans. There are very\n",
      "few white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had behaved well from\n",
      "the first, I soon found myself a sort of privileged person. I was given\n",
      "a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of Mount\n",
      "Harriet, and I was left pretty much to myself. It is a dreary,\n",
      "fever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infested\n",
      "with wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned\n",
      "dart at us if they saw a chance. There was digging, and ditching, and\n",
      "yam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy\n",
      "enough all day; though in the evening we had a little time to\n",
      "ourselves. Among other things, I learned to dispense drugs for the\n",
      "surgeon, and picked up a smattering of his knowledge. All the time I\n",
      "was on the lookout for a chance of escape; but it is hundreds of miles\n",
      "from any other land, and there is little or no wind in those seas: so\n",
      "it was a terribly difficult job to get away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sporting young chap, and the\n",
      "other young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play\n",
      "cards. The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to his\n",
      "sitting-room, with a small window between us. Often, if I felt\n",
      "lonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then,\n",
      "standing there, I could hear their talk and watch their play. I am fond\n",
      "of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one to\n",
      "watch the others. There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, and\n",
      "Lieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops, and\n",
      "there was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-officials,\n",
      "crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game. A very snug little\n",
      "party they used to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that was that\n",
      "the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win. Mind, I\n",
      "don’t say that there was anything unfair, but so it was. These\n",
      "prison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had\n",
      "been at the Andamans, and they knew each other’s game to a point, while\n",
      "the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down\n",
      "anyhow. Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, and the\n",
      "poorer they got the more keen they were to play. Major Sholto was the\n",
      "hardest hit. He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon it\n",
      "came to notes of hand and for big sums. He sometimes would win for a\n",
      "few deals, just to give him heart, and then the luck would set in\n",
      "against him worse than ever. All day he would wander about as black as\n",
      "thunder, and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One night he lost even more heavily than usual. I was sitting in my\n",
      "hut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to\n",
      "their quarters. They were bosom friends, those two, and never far\n",
      "apart. The major was raving about his losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘It’s all up, Morstan,’ he was saying, as they passed my hut. ‘I shall\n",
      "have to send in my papers. I am a ruined man.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Nonsense, old chap!’ said the other, slapping him upon the shoulder.\n",
      "‘I’ve had a nasty facer myself, but—’ That was all I could hear, but it\n",
      "was enough to set me thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach: so I\n",
      "took the chance of speaking to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘I wish to have your advice, major,’ said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Well, Small, what is it?’ he asked, taking his cheroot from his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘I wanted to ask you, sir,’ said I, ‘who is the proper person to whom\n",
      "hidden treasure should be handed over. I know where half a million\n",
      "worth lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhaps the best\n",
      "thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper\n",
      "authorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for\n",
      "me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Half a million, Small?’ he gasped, looking hard at me to see if I was\n",
      "in earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Quite that, sir,—in jewels and pearls. It lies there ready for any\n",
      "one. And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed\n",
      "and cannot hold property, so that it belongs to the first comer.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘To government, Small,’ he stammered,—‘to government.’ But he said it\n",
      "in a halting fashion, and I knew in my heart that I had got him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘You think, then, sir, that I should give the information to the\n",
      "Governor-General?’ said I, quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Well, well, you must not do anything rash, or that you might repent.\n",
      "Let me hear all about it, Small. Give me the facts.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told him the whole story, with small changes so that he could not\n",
      "identify the places. When I had finished he stood stock still and full\n",
      "of thought. I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a\n",
      "struggle going on within him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘This is a very important matter, Small,’ he said, at last. ‘You must\n",
      "not say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two nights later he and his friend Captain Morstan came to my hut in\n",
      "the dead of the night with a lantern.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own\n",
      "lips, Small,’ said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I repeated it as I had told it before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘It rings true, eh?’ said he. ‘It’s good enough to act upon?’\n",
      "\n",
      "“Captain Morstan nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Look here, Small,’ said the major. ‘We have been talking it over, my\n",
      "friend here and I, and we have come to the conclusion that this secret\n",
      "of yours is hardly a government matter, after all, but is a private\n",
      "concern of your own, which of course you have the power of disposing of\n",
      "as you think best. Now, the question is, what price would you ask for\n",
      "it? We might be inclined to take it up, and at least look into it, if\n",
      "we could agree as to terms.’ He tried to speak in a cool, careless way,\n",
      "but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Why, as to that, gentlemen,’ I answered, trying also to be cool, but\n",
      "feeling as excited as he did, ‘there is only one bargain which a man in\n",
      "my position can make. I shall want you to help me to my freedom, and to\n",
      "help my three companions to theirs. We shall then take you into\n",
      "partnership, and give you a fifth share to divide between you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Hum!’ said he. ‘A fifth share! That is not very tempting.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘It would come to fifty thousand apiece,’ said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘But how can we gain your freedom? You know very well that you ask an\n",
      "impossibility.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Nothing of the sort,’ I answered. ‘I have thought it all out to the\n",
      "last detail. The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit\n",
      "for the voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a time. There\n",
      "are plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which would\n",
      "serve our turn well. Do you bring one over. We shall engage to get\n",
      "aboard her by night, and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian\n",
      "coast you will have done your part of the bargain.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘If there were only one,’ he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘None or all,’ I answered. ‘We have sworn it. The four of us must\n",
      "always act together.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘You see, Morstan,’ said he, ‘Small is a man of his word. He does not\n",

      "both the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and mark the\n",
      "place in the wall where the treasure was hid. Major Sholto was to go to\n",
      "India to test our story. If he found the box he was to leave it there,\n",
      "to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage, which was to lie\n",
      "off Rutland Island, and to which we were to make our way, and finally\n",
      "to return to his duties. Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave of\n",
      "absence, to meet us at Agra, and there we were to have a final division\n",
      "of the treasure, he taking the major’s share as well as his own. All\n",
      "this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or\n",
      "the lips utter. I sat up all night with paper and ink, and by the\n",
      "morning I had the two charts all ready, signed with the sign of\n",
      "four,—that is, of Abdullah, Akbar, Mahomet, and myself.\n",

      "“Well, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that my\n",
      "friend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey. I’ll\n",
      "make it as short as I can. The villain Sholto went off to India, but he\n",
      "never came back again. Captain Morstan showed me his name among a list\n",
      "of passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards. His\n",
      "uncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army, yet he\n",
      "could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us. Morstan went over\n",
      "to Agra shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, that the\n",
      "treasure was indeed gone. The scoundrel had stolen it all, without\n",
      "carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret.\n",
      "From that day I lived only for vengeance. I thought of it by day and I\n",
      "nursed it by night. It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with\n",
      "me. I cared nothing for the law,—nothing for the gallows. To escape, to\n",
      "track down Sholto, to have my hand upon his throat,—that was my one\n",
      "thought. Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my\n",
      "mind than the slaying of Sholto.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never one\n",
      "which I did not carry out. But it was weary years before my time came.\n",
      "I have told you that I had picked up something of medicine. One day\n",
      "when Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was\n",
      "picked up by a convict-gang in the woods. He was sick to death, and had\n",
      "gone to a lonely place to die. I took him in hand, though he was as\n",
      "venomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him all\n",
      "right and able to walk. He took a kind of fancy to me then, and would\n",
      "hardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut. I\n",
      "learned a little of his lingo from him, and this made him all the\n",
      "fonder of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tonga—for that was his name—was a fine boatman, and owned a big, roomy\n",
      "canoe of his own. When I found that he was devoted to me and would do\n",
      "anything to serve me, I saw my chance of escape. I talked it over with\n",
      "him. He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf\n",
      "which was never guarded, and there he was to pick me up. I gave him\n",
      "directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams,\n",
      "cocoa-nuts, and sweet potatoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was stanch and true, was little Tonga. No man ever had a more\n",

      "chanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there,—a vile\n",
      "Pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me. I\n",
      "had always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It was as if fate\n",
      "had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the\n",
      "island. He stood on the bank with his back to me, and his carbine on\n",
      "his shoulder. I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with,\n",
      "but none could I see. Then a queer thought came into my head and showed\n",
      "me where I could lay my hand on a weapon. I sat down in the darkness\n",
      "and unstrapped my wooden leg. With three long hops I was on him. He put\n",
      "his carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full, and knocked the\n",
      "whole front of his skull in. You can see the split in the wood now\n",
      "where I hit him. We both went down together, for I could not keep my\n",
      "balance, but when I got up I found him still lying quiet enough. I made\n",
      "for the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea. Tonga had brought\n",
      "all his earthly possessions with him, his arms and his gods. Among\n",
      "other things, he had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman cocoa-nut\n",
      "matting, with which I made a sort of sail. For ten days we were beating\n",
      "about, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we were picked up by a\n",
      "trader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malay\n",
      "pilgrims. They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I soon managed to settle\n",
      "down among them. They had one very good quality: they let you alone and\n",
      "asked no questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and\n",
      "I went through, you would not thank me, for I would have you here until\n",
      "the sun was shining. Here and there we drifted about the world,\n",
      "something always turning up to keep us from London. All the time,\n",
      "however, I never lost sight of my purpose. I would dream of Sholto at\n",
      "night. A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep. At last, however,\n",
      "some three or four years ago, we found ourselves in England. I had no\n",
      "great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set to work to\n",
      "discover whether he had realised the treasure, or if he still had it. I\n",
      "made friends with someone who could help me,—I name no names, for I\n",
      "don’t want to get any one else in a hole,—and I soon found that he\n",
      "still had the jewels. Then I tried to get at him in many ways; but he\n",
      "was pretty sly, and had always two prize-fighters, besides his sons and\n",
      "his khitmutgar, on guard over him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One day, however, I got word that he was dying. I hurried at once to\n",
      "the garden, mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that, and,\n",
      "looking through the window, I saw him lying in his bed, with his sons\n",
      "on each side of him. I’d have come through and taken my chance with the\n",
      "three of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped, and I knew\n",
      "that he was gone. I got into his room that same night, though, and I\n",
      "searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he had\n",
      "hidden our jewels. There was not a line, however: so I came away,\n",
      "bitter and savage as a man could be. Before I left I bethought me that\n",
      "if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know\n",
      "that I had left some mark of our hatred; so I scrawled down the sign of\n",
      "the four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on his\n",
      "bosom. It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without\n",
      "some token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs\n",
      "and other such places as the black cannibal. He would eat raw meat and\n",
      "dance his war-dance: so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day’s\n",
      "work. I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for some\n",
      "years there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for the\n",
      "treasure. At last, however, came what we had waited for so long. The\n",
      "treasure had been found. It was up at the top of the house, in Mr.\n",
      "Bartholomew Sholto’s chemical laboratory. I came at once and had a look\n",
      "at the place, but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to make\n",
      "my way up to it. I learned, however, about a trap-door in the roof, and\n",
      "also about Mr. Sholto’s supper-hour. It seemed to me that I could\n",
      "manage the thing easily through Tonga. I brought him out with me with a\n",
      "long rope wound round his waist. He could climb like a cat, and he soon\n",
      "made his way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have it,\n",
      "Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost. Tonga thought he\n",
      "had done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by\n",
      "the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock. Very much\n",
      "surprised was he when I made at him with the rope’s end and cursed him\n",
      "for a little blood-thirsty imp. I took the treasure-box and let it\n",
      "down, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four\n",
      "upon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to those\n",
      "who had most right to them. Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the\n",
      "window, and made off the way that he had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know that I have anything else to tell you. I had heard a\n",
      "waterman speak of the speed of Smith’s launch the _Aurora_, so I\n",
      "thought she would be a handy craft for our escape. I engaged with old\n",
      "Smith, and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship. He\n",
      "knew, no doubt, that there was some screw loose, but he was not in our\n",
      "secrets. All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it\n",
      "is not to amuse you,—for you have not done me a very good turn,—but it\n",
      "is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back\n",
      "nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served\n",
      "by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A very remarkable account,” said Sherlock Holmes. “A fitting wind-up\n",
      "to an extremely interesting case. There is nothing at all new to me in\n",
      "the latter part of your narrative, except that you brought your own\n",
      "rope. That I did not know. By the way, I had hoped that Tonga had lost\n",

      "I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me. I\n",
      "shall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe under\n",
      "lock and key. The cab still waits, and there are two inspectors\n",

      "“Well, and there is the end of our little drama,” I remarked, after we\n",
      "had set some time smoking in silence. “I fear that it may be the last\n",
      "investigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your\n",

      "I was a little hurt. “Have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my\n",
      "choice?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all. I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I\n",
      "ever met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been\n",
      "doing. She had a decided genius that way: witness the way in which she\n",
      "preserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father. But\n",
      "love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to\n",
      "that true cold reason which I place above all things. I should never\n",
      "marry myself, lest I bias my judgment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I trust,” said I, laughing, “that my judgment may survive the ordeal.\n",
      "But you look weary.”\n",
